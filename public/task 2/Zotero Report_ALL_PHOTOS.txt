    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Brisbane City Council
    Abstract 	Birds eye view looking north. Closest to camera on hill
    above mangroves are the warders' quarters. Following the road from
    there the Chief Superintendent's residence and gardens can be see
    through the trees. Further along on the beach side is the chief
    warder's residence. The large number of buildings close together
    comprised the stockade and below this, on the flats, are the dairy
    and pig and sheep yards.

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that the image is
        post-1903, as it was taken from an airplane. The only vegetation
        looks to be around a few of the buildings and to the far left,
        where it appears denser.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is open space and a large complex. There is a
        horseshoe-shaped road, which leads around to a cluster of
        buildings. There is possibly a creek/river to the right of the
        image, I can’t really tell.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        It looks like a survey or surveillance shot. Could be to assess
        the size of the penal establishment or determine if it would be
        a good position for an army in a war.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It’s definitely spontaneous as when you’re in a plane you can’t
        stage a photo, it happens in real-time.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        Post-1903, as it was taken from an airplane.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The focus of the photo is the penal establishment, and not the
        surrounding water or land.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is of items the
        prisoners would have been familiar with. Items range from dice
        to a straitjacket. Seeing items with which prisoners hung
        themselves, knives they stabbed themselves with, and a bottle
        with tips of fingers they cut off to go to the hospital, shows
        desperation and hopelessness. The items grouped together like
        they are, with explanations for each item has far more of an
        impact than if the items were displayed singularly.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        A strait jacket, rope, knife, leg irons, cannonball, dice,
        tools, waist belt, keys, and a body belt.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        A display of items the prisoners would have been familiar with,
        to show people in more modern times.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is staged as everything is arranged for the picture.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It is really hard to tell from the

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The information cards are in the background and the items on
        display are in the foreground.

        Backview of stockade, St Helena Penal Establishment

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Brisbane City Council
    Abstract 	This view is taken from near the warders' barracks. In the
    foreground are fields ready for crops. On the left behind the
    stockade wall is the blacksmith (two chimneys) and the carpenters
    shop. Behind them is the long administration building. Behind the
    admin building are the twin roofs of the double storeyed workshops.
    In the middle of the stockade is the high guardhouse which was over
    the entrance. On either side of this were two cell blocks. In the
    right front corner joining onto the stockade wall was the lime
    store, then the food preparation are - kitchen, storeroom, bakery,
    and butchers and a room for salting and smoking meat. To the right
    of the roadway was the chief superintendent's house and at the end
    of the roadway was the chief warder's residence.

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a plantation or
        farming village. It has a very neat, tidy appearance. There are
        many large buildings with two clean, straight roads. There is a
        single figure which I take as being a male. For such a large
        quantity of buildings, there appear to be very few people. The
        field in the foreground looks ploughed but the plot behind the
        figure looks like it may have rows of something growing.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are many buildings, a man walking on a road, a freshly
        ploughed field, an irrigation channel, palm trees, and two
        cylindrical objects made from brick. Silo’s as they look too
        large to be chimneys.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I think it was taken to showcase the space for crops that the
        penal establishment had.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        I think it was spontaneous as the figure seems to be mid-step
        and looks to be looking at the plot in front of him.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It’s hard to tell. The only way to know is from the figure’s
        clothing however he is too far away to see clearly.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The foreground showcases the area available to grow crops. The
        background features large buildings behind a high fence, which
        clearly separates the two locations.

        Bootmaker's shop, H.M. Penal establishment, St Helena

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Brisbane City Council
    Abstract 	The workshops were established within the stockade by
    1879. Long term prisoners were taught a trade in the workshops while
    short-term prisoners worked in the fields. The island was largely
    self-sufficient and excess items were sold to government
    departments. The boot-makers and saddlers produced a range of items
    from shoelaces to saddles. Government regulations did not allow
    photographing prisoners' faces.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is an industrious
        scene. Men are busy at work making shoes, as there are shoe
        lasts and shapers on the wall. There are two saddles, but it is
        not clear whether saddles are being made or stored while the men
        are at work. The building they are in is large and airy from the
        many windows shown.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are prisoners, tools, a watering can, and a grinding
        wheel. And there are shoe lasts and sharpers on the wall. There
        are two saddles, but it is not clear whether the saddles are
        being made or stored while the men are at work. The men are
        wearing a uniform, with three men having clearly visible numbers
        on the back of their shirts. There is a supervisor-looking man
        in the distance of the photo, who is the only man facing the camera.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I think the picture was taken to show how prisoners are used as
        free labour (Taylor 2010). The men are shown busily working,
        doing their day’s work, and learning new skills (Queensland
        Government 2015).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        I think the photo is staged to present the workshop in the best
        light. Everyone has their back turned when most people would
        have looked toward the camera, especially in those days when
        photography was new and a novelty.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        I think it is sometime before or around 1882 as the grinding
        wheel would indicate no electricity. Also, there are no lights
        hanging from the roof. I say before or around 1882 because
        electricity was supplied to Brisbane in 1882 (Scholz Electrical
        2021).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        There is a warder in the background, facing toward the camera,
        the only man to do so. The men in the foreground are standing,
        while some men in the background are sitting.

        Building plan, St Helena

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	CyArk
    Abstract 	Building plan showing prisoners cells, buildings,
    workshops, stockade fence In 1867, the overcrowding of Brisbane
    prisons drove the decision for the St Helena quarantine station to
    be converted into a prison, with prisoners being transferred from
    the prison hulk to the island and Proserpine’s Captain John McDonald
    becoming St Helena’s first Superintendent.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that this is a plan for a
        community (I am ignoring the caption at the bottom of the
        picture). I notice everything is very straight, I cannot see a
        curve anywhere. There are tram lines, with wings, so could be a
        military compound. I sense that the area is large or isolated as
        it has its own hospital, church, school, butcher shop, and
        bakery. It is not until I see the words cell and warder that I
        know it’s a prison.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are symmetrical yards and grass plots, tram lines,
        building “wings”, a hospital, a church, a school, a butcher
        shop, and a bakery. There is a space allotted for workshops for
        the blacksmith, carpenters, and painters.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        It’s a plan for how the stockade at the penal establishment
        would be layed out.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is a plan so staged.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        Pre 1939s because of the language, “lumber”, and “dispensary”.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The plan is scaled with everything to its proportion.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that a man in light
        clothes is walking down a corridor or standing in the corridor,
        his arms are by his side as the photo is taken. There appear to
        be many identical doorways, with numbers above each so I get the
        impression a lot of people live or work here.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is a prisoner in a hallway. The floors, walls, and roof
        look to be made from timber. The roof is high with a circular
        hole cut out of it which is odd. There are a lot of small
        windows near the roof. It could be the angle of the image, but
        the doorways appear to me to be narrow, again, odd.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I think the photo was taken to show the inside of the prison.
        Possibly to show how clean and modern it was.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        I think it was staged. The prisoner is standing still in the
        middle of the picture and hallway. It may not even be a
        prisoner. It may be a warder dressed as a prisoner for the photo.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It is sometime between 1882 and 1932, probably closer to the
        1882 period. The timber in a tongue-and-groove fashion seems old
        to me, and I think I can make out a light hanging from the roof.
        Electricity reached Brisbane in 1882 (Scholz Electrical 2021).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The camera is slightly pointing to the left, the photo doesn’t
        shoot straight down the hallway. This allows a better view of
        the cell door and the number in the foreground. You even get a
        look at the internal wall of cell nine. The doorways merge into
        being just the wall in the background.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a mugshot of
        two men. The top man has “J Jones” with his picture which is
        what I am guessing is his name and not the photographers, as the
        bottom man does not have this. But why doesn’t the bottom man
        have this? Perhaps because the top man is from a few years after
        the bottom man. The top man has his prison number, 58.10, while
        the bottom man is 25. The later man again has a different
        numbering system than the earlier prisoner. The top mans eyes
        look fierce and angry while the bottom mans eyes are softer.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        Mugshots of two men who attempted to escape St Helena.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To show the faces of the two men who unsuccessfully tried to
        escape, Henry Craig and David McIntyre (Queensland State
        Archives 2021).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is staged as they are mugshots taken by the police.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        Around the 16 November 1911, the two mugshots would have placed
        together like they are as that is when they handed themselves in
        (Queensland State Archives 2021). The original photos were taken
        in 1910 and 1906, as per the mugshots.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        It is a mugshot of faces, front on and profile.

        Freed unionist shearers following the 1891 shearers' strike

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	State Library of Queensland
    Abstract 	This is a black-and-white poster showing 13 shearers who
    had been jailed in 1891 during the central Queensland Shearers'
    Strike. Across the top of the poster, in large letters, is printed
    'FREEDOM WITHOUT DISHONOUR' and 'UNIONIST PRISONERS'. The poster
    goes on to identify each man individually as having been sentenced
    at Rockhampton for causes connected to the 1891 'Bush Strike'.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a poster of a
        group of men, outdoors, sitting on a set of stairs. They are all
        well-dressed, and a few have suits on. The writing informs that
        they are released, union prisoners. Sentenced in Rockhampton.
        All men have facial hair, except one, which is typical of the
        time period.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        A group of men, outdoors, sitting on a set of stairs. A banner
        is above and names below.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I think it was taken because the shearers wanted people to know
        that they had been released, and they still stand united as
        unionists and for the cause. “One of these, William Hamilton,
        was later to become Member of the Legislative Assembly for
        Gregory, Minister for Mines and President of the Legislative
        Council of Queensland” (Queensland Government 2015).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is staged as they are sitting closely, posing for the camera.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        Around the turn of the 19^th /20^th century. There clothes are
        from that era, and all but one has facial hair popular at that
        time. Four of the men have on ties, similar to todays ties,
        which were not popular until the 1915-1920 era (Hendrik 2013).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The group is in the foreground and there are some trees and a
        building in the background.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a photo of a
        document from the General Record and Description of Prisoners
        book, page 512. It has the prisoner’s name, Henry Craig, and his
        alias. All of his particulars are recorded as well as any
        previous convictions. In red ink, it has a number corresponding
        to what number photo he is in a record. It has dates, details,
        and punishments given of any misdemeanors while in prison, as
        well as his discharge details.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        A photo of a document from the General Record and Description of
        Prisoners book, page 512.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To show what was recorded on prisoners’ files. Each one of these
        forms is completed at Brisbane Gaol before the prisoner is sent
        to St Helena (Unknown 20 March 1878).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is planned as it’s a purposeful photo of a page of a book.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        1906 as it is written on the admission line.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        It is a photo of a page in a book.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it looks like a farm.
        It seems very neat, tidy, and organised. The roads seem
        exceptionally clean and straight. There are a lot of straight
        lines in the whole image.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are buildings behind a fence and an industrial-looking
        building in the distance. There are two figures in the fields,
        one with a horse. There are paddocks, and I’m not sure what the
        white structure is.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        It may have been taken as a means to promote and report back on
        the success of the prison without walls camp (Taylor 2010). This
        idea combined the need for self-sufficiency and free farm labour
        (Taylor 2010; Unknown 20 March 1878). This image shows prisoners
        working the open fields, not chained or with a warder in sight.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        I think it has been staged. The two prisoners look to be
        standing still. One does not have any tools or water buckets,
        and the other is standing in front of a horse, looking forward
        or back, not on the side as would expect if walking the horse.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It came from the period sometime between 1913 and 1932. I can
        tell this because the prison without walls idea did not take
        hold until around 1913 (Taylor 2010), and St Helena Prison
        closed in 1932 (Alfredson 1983).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        Something is growing in the foreground. The large industrial
        building and chimney are in the background. The photo looks to
        be attempting to show as much of the farm as possible.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a 3d model of
        the prison. It is detailed, as there are cows in a paddock,
        three garden beds, and men on the tram line. It is behind glass,
        so the view is not clear.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        It is a 3d model of the prison. It is detailed, as there are
        cows in a paddock, three garden beds, and men on the tram line.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten and
        learn about life in the jail. It shows how the prison was
        sectioned and how big the stockade was.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern. The photo is coloured and clear. The
        stockade is from around 1930s when the penal establishment closed.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The model is the focus. The glare off the glass makes it hard to
        see well.

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a mugshot of
        two prisoners. The image contains their names, alias, and
        release details. The numbers 106 and 107 could be their prisoner
        numbers or their rank among released prisoners. They appear to
        have the same jacket on, and both are wearing white underneath.
        One a white button-up shirt, the other a neckerchief. Both have
        beards which fits the time period. The man on the right has
        piercing eyes and appears older than the other man, but it may
        just be his wilder beard. Both men seem to be leaning toward my
        left.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        A photo of a document from the Queensland Police Museum with two
        men’s mugshots.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        It is the release card of two men associated with the industrial
        dispute of 1891, the Barcaldine Shearers' Strike (Queensland
        State Archives 2021).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is planned as it’s a purposeful photo of a page of a book.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        1891 as it is written on the form.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        It is a photo of a page in a book.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that the building looks
        like a workplace or a farm building.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are five doors down the side of the building and a more
        decorative curved door at the end. It looks that down the side
        of the building there is a high window above every low window
        and door. Tools look to be leaning against the wall. A small
        tank sits at the far end of the building but there is no
        vegetation, or people, to be seen. The end of the building, in
        the foreground, looks to me to be an addition as it does not fit
        with the rest of the building. There is a taller section of the
        building which has a decorative verandah and looks to have bars
        on its windows. There is a flag at full mast indicating that
        there are people in or around the building.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I think it was taken just to show other people what’s at St Helena.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It’s hard to tell. The photo could have been both.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It is hard to say. I can’t see the flag which may have helped,
        and there are no people.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The photo was taken to make the building the focal point. The
        shot was set up to make sure the entire building was captured.
        Maybe the out-of-place part of the building in the foreground
        was a point of interest because the building could have been
        shot in other positions.

        Old signal gun, St Helena Penal Establishment 24 pounder

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Brisbane City Council
    Abstract 	In November 1867, a 24 pounder signal cannon was brought
    to the island and positioned near the superintendent's cottage. This
    was fired into the bay to attract the attention of the mainland in
    the event of an escape.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that the first thing I see
        is a smartly dressed man standing by a cannon. I cannot tell if
        the canon is in use, as I cannot see any ammunition around it.
        The cannon appears to point through a gap in a hedge, bamboo, or
        line of tree foliage. Behind the man, fruit trees stand between
        him and a building. Beside the man stand two large, and
        presumably old, Norfolk Pines.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are Norfolk Pines, a smartly dressed gentleman, a cannon,
        fruit trees, a building, and some type of hedging, maybe bamboo.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        It may have been taken as a memento, or the cannon may have been
        being removed.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        The man is merely posing with the cannon as he is not dressed to
        load and fire it. He would also be of too high of social
        standing to do so I think, from his outfit.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        I think the image is from around the late 1800s to just after
        the turn of the century. The man has a bowler hat on, carries a
        cane/stick, and is wearing a three-piece suit. He is wearing
        fashion from around the 1870s (Matthews 2016) and is sporting a
        moustache that fits the time period. Also, the cannon must have
        been unused from around the turn of the century as in a
        newspaper article from 1916 they refer to it as historic and
        obsolete (Unknown 27 November 1916). It may have become obsolete
        around the turn of the century as phone exchanges reached
        Brisbane in the late 1880s (Miller 2013).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The man and the cannon are the focus of the image. In the
        background, there are some fruit trees and a building, which
        seem to have nothing to do with the photo.

        Only nown painting of St Helena Island as a working prison

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Charles Winn
    Abstract 	In 2013, a local Brisbane resident, Trisha Anderson,
    discovered this watercolour wrapped up in plastic and towels hidden
    in a wardrobe of her Hendra home. Her grandfather, William Gall, was
    a comptroller of the Queensland prisons in the late 19th and early
    20th centuries. One of his jobs was to regularly travel to and
    inspect St Helena Island...the painting was presented to him when he
    retired in the early 1920's. She later learned that this is the only
    painting of St Helena Island in existence.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a colourful
        painting.It looks like it is a large farm.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        A body of water, a long jetty, a sailboat, and birds flying low
        over the water. People are depicted at work as there is smoke
        coming from a large industrial-looking building. There are
        paddocks, showing different things being grown in each one.  

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I think it was painted in a prisoner’s free time. From boredom
        or possibly as a memento, or gift. It is said to be “the only
        painting of St Helena Island as a working prison, as painted by
        an inmate” (Bochenski 9 December 2013), according to historians.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is a painting.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It is hard to put a date on it but appears early because of the
        buildings, and there is no tram line, which was built in the
        latter part of the 1870s (Queensland Government 2015).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The body of water, birds, sailboat, and jetty is in the
        foreground. This could be because this is the first glimpse of
        the island you get from the boat, or the artist finds it softens
        the painting of a penal establishment. The paddocks and
        buildings in the background appear more like a farm than penal
        establishment.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is the artist’s
        interpretation of St Helena as there are no hills/mountains on
        the Island or surrounding it to the best of my knowledge. The
        sketch looks peaceful with a sailboat on the water, small
        ripple-like waves, and abundant vegetation. The artist has
        included some buildings and a vertical cylindrical shape which
        is above and slightly to the left of the boat. It towers above
        the trees, so I am not sure if it is a chimney or something else.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        A sketch of the artist’s interpretation of St Helena.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        An interpretation of St Helena.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is planned as it’s a hand sketch, someone has hand sketched it.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It is very early, maybe early 1860s, as there has not yet been
        any clearing of the trees and only a handful of buildings.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        It is a hand-drawn sketch.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a detailed
        plan. It is colour coded and clearly labelled. There is a north
        arrow, scale, and legend. It shows what was being grown on the
        island, and where all the buildings were located. It’s quite
        easy to understand.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that the room is very
        small. The hammock takes up almost all space. The bars on the
        door lead me to believe this is a cell to confine someone. I
        also noticed straight away how thick the metal is.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is a hammock and a cell door with iron bars.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To appreciate how the prisoners lived in the past and to share
        with others. Cells were either 4ft x 9ft or 5ft x 9ft (Unknown
        23 April 1905).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is staged, as it is in a museum.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The room being photographed…The heavy-looking door and timber
        walling make me think it is from an earlier time period.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The heavy timber door separates the photographer from the room
        inside, only able to peer through the iron bars. The room is
        empty but for a hammock, however, around 1911 furniture started
        to be introduced  (Unknown 21 October 1911).

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a not clear
        image of an information board on a timber wall. There are
        pictures and schedules, a rations list, and information. It is a
        good insight into the prisoners lives.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        It is an information board on a timber, tongue and groove wall.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten and
        learn about life in the prison. It shows how the prisoners
        lived, ate, and played. The prisoners complained of being not
        given the correct amount of meat (Unknown 23 April 1905), so
        maybe this was the case with other rations, the board may not
        indicate actual amounts.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern but the weights and measurements
        indicate the information is from an earlier time, from before
        1932 when the prison closed.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The information board is the focus. It is a little fuzzy but I
        can make out most of the information.

          Notes:

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a photo of an
        item placed on a wall. The statistics are given from the minutes
        of evidence taken before the select committee (stated on the
        right of the picture, at the bottom). It has John Macdonald,
        Superintendent printed at the bottom. Does this indicate these
        events took place while John Macdonald was superintendent?

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is an information board hung on a wall.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten and
        learn about life in the jail. The information given is regarding
        punishments given for breaking prison rules between 1867 and
        1869. Prisoner names are listed, what the offence was, the
        punishment given, the date, and by whom the punishment was
        awarded by.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern. The photo is coloured and clear. The
        information is from around 1870, as that’s the period recorded.
        You can also tell by the punishments that were delivered. The
        prisoner who broke the rules the most was James English. Henry
        Wheeler was punished for “singing in ward”. The most favoured
        punishment was solitary confinement - locked in a small, dark,
        solitary cell for 23 hrs a day (Unknown 23 April 1905) - and the
        year with the most punishments was 1868.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The sign is the focus.

        Saddler's shop, H.M. Penal Establishment, St Helena

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Brisbane City Council
    Abstract 	The workshops were established within the stockade by
    1879. Long term prisoners were taught a trade in the workshops while
    short-term prisoners worked in the fields. The island was largely
    self-sufficient and excess items were sold to government
    departments. The boot-makers and saddlers produced a range of items
    from shoelaces to saddles. Government regulations did not allow
    photographing prisoners' faces

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a place of work
        or training. The men have their backs to the camera, with one
        man having the word tea, however, when looking closer it is
        actually a number, 183 or 180 with a strike through it. Another
        number, 56 possibly, has been placed under this.  

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is a mallet and a variety of other tools, and prisoners.
        There look to be lots of leather straps/strips and stirrups.
        Each workstation appears to have an identical tool board, with a
        number and the word saddler. So, they are making saddles.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I think the photo was taken to show the kinds of work and skills
        training the prisoners undertake

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        I think the photo is staged as the men have their backs to the
        camera. The man in the foreground looks as though he is sitting
        and waiting for it to be done.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        I think it is sometime before or around 1882 as the grinding
        wheel would indicate no electricity. Also, there are no lights
        hanging from the roof. I say before or around 1882 because
        electricity was supplied to Brisbane in 1882 (Scholz Electrical
        2021).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        It looks as though the photographer has purposefully avoided
        capturing the rest of the room. The focus is on the first three
        men in the foreground. The man in the foreground has his tools
        spread on the bench so they are clearly visible.

        Saint Helena Island prisoner cemetery

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Judi Gray
    Abstract 	Prisoners Cemetery at St Helena Island. Only prison
    numbers are listed on their crosses; prisoners had no right to their
    names. The crosses all face the bay overlooking Brisbane, to enforce
    the fact that they were never going to leave or escape the island
    and signify the freedom of the mainland that they had lost.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is of a cemetery.
        All the headstones/crosses are the same. Same dimensions, and
        the same material. The image shows a partial area of the
        cemetery, not the whole of it. The crosses appear to be stone or
        cement and are discoloured. Due to the discolouring, and shadow,
        I cannot see any identifying details etched onto the cross of
        who is buried there. Perhaps they are for display purposes only,
        to set the scene if you will. I count around 38 crosses.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are trees, grass, a white picket fence and grave crosses
        made of cement or stone.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern. The photo is coloured and clear.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The photo tries to show as many grave crosses as possible. The
        fence in the background shows that in death they were still
        fenced in. in 1878 there were already 12 prisoners buried in the
        prisoners cemetery (Unknown 20 March 1878).

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a rectangle in
        the water made up of posts of some sort. The posts are all the
        same dimensions, all the same width, etc. There are water level
        markings on the posts. There are gaps in the rectangular shape,
        I am not sure if it is for a reason or if the missing posts have
        rotted or broken away. I can’t be sure how deep the water is
        around the shape although there appears to be sand at the bottom
        left of the image.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are five pylons that a bridge or jetty may have sat on. In
        the distance, there are some industrial and city-like buildings.
        There is also a large rectangular shape in the water, made up of
        steel from the tramway track, driven vertically into the sand
        (Whittington 28 August 2019).

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern. The photo is coloured and clear. It
        is hard to say, but before it closed in 1932. The poles look old
        but could just be worn from being in the salt water, near mangroves.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The swimming pool is in the foreground, the focus of the image.
        In the background are a body of water and a town or city. It is
        small on the horizon, showing how isolated the prisoners were.

        Sisal hemp, raspador, silos and old chimney, St Helena Penal
        Establishment

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Brisbane City Council
    Abstract 	Prisoners are using a raspador on stems of sisal hemp to
    remove the pulp and produce the fibre which was used to make rope.
    In the background are some fodder silos which are built into the
    ground to strengthen them. The chimney in the middle was from the
    old sugar mill. Government regulations did not allow photographing
    prisoners' faces.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that two men are working.
        They are wearing similar clothes and are outdoors. The man at
        the rear seems to be holding a bucket.  I can’t tell what is on
        the table in the foreground.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are two prisoners and there is a machine they are using
        that looks to be run by belts. There are two funny looking A
        shape buildings and a wooden building that has boards falling
        off the walls, leaving holes. A square, tall, brick structure
        rises above a small tank. Two canvas sheets seem to be laying
        around, but I can’t tell what is draped over one of them.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        It shows men working, not just sitting in cells, and they are
        not shackled up, which could be trying to show reformation is
        working. Propaganda for the prison, for funding, etc.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        Staged, I think. The machine’s belts are loose which would
        indicate it’s not working, as the belts would be tensioned if
        being used.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It’s hard to tell from this photo what era it is from.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The men and machine are the focus of the image.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a
        cross-sectional sketch of a wooden building. It has a gable roof
        with ten windows. Sections B and C look to have heater coils.
        Sections A, B, and C appear to have pipes that run to or from
        something on the outside of the building labelled E. I am unsure
        what the things are labelled D.

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        a cross-sectional sketch of the inside of a sugar mill. It has a
        gable roof with ten windows. Sections B and C look to have
        heater coils. Sections A, B, and C appear to have pipes that run
        to or from something on the outside of the building labelled

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To show the workings of the mill or a plan for a new sugar mill.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is staged as it’s a photo of a sketch.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        If it is the original mill, then it would be around 1869, as
        that is when it was built Whittington 13 February 2021). From
        all accounts, the sugar production on St Helena was quite
        lucrative (Queensland Government 2015).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        It is a sketch of the inside of a building so looks like the
        mill has been sliced down the middle.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a map from
        Queensland Government. It has a scale, north arrow, and legend
        with clearly interpreted icons. The map is well labelled,
        showing all key features, and indicates that the island is
        almost entirely surrounded by mangroves.

        St Helena Island towards Manly

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Patricia Woods
    Abstract 	The crumbling ruins backed by the city of Brisbane, a
    different perspective from the one encountered by convicts and their
    warders many years ago. The ruins are in poor condition due to the
    materials from which the blocks were built so most of them have
    fences around them to stop tourists destroying them.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is of a ruined
        building. The bright green grass and bright blue water look out
        of place against the crumbling building. There is a large body
        of water with a large town beyond that.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        A ruined building, a body of water, a city or town, grass,
        trees, and a windmill. Bracing is holding up sections of the
        building.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten and
        show how isolated the prisoners were.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern. It is coloured and clear. The
        building dates pre-1932.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        There is a large amount of grass in the foreground as they had
        to stand far enough back to get the full ruin into the shot. The
        city or town in the background is used as an interesting
        backdrop, or as a reflection of how far away from civilisation
        the island is.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a dark timber
        door, bolted and padlocked shut. The door looks like a heavy
        door, solid timber possibly. As with everything else seen in the
        image, the padlock looks solid and of a large size. It all looks
        from an earlier time period. The keyhole is hidden beneath a
        movable metal piece on the body of the padlock.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is a dark timber door, bolted and padlocked shut. The
        heavy steel bolt is attached to the door by large, thick rivets.
        The door also has solid-looking screws or similar. The padlock
        reads “Chubb London”.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern. The photo is coloured and clear. The
        padlock and door are from the turn of the century. Newer prisons
        would have had metal doors I think.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The focus is on the padlock and the locking bolt, showing how
        well-guarded the men were.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a large
        compound. There are people around a tram at the elaborate
        entrance. It is hard to tell but I think there is a figure on a
        horse in the centre of the compound and some people to its left.
        This is a photo of a sketch.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are multiple storied buildings, a church, an
        industrial-looking building with smoke coming from a tall
        chimney, and lookout towers. The compound dominates the
        landscape with only a few small hills, palms, trees, and I think
        a watercourse.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To display plans for a new prison that would be made from brick
        instead of wood (Unknown 5 February 1914).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is a plan.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        1914. You can tell not more modern because it doesn’t have razor
        wire.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The focus is on the plan of the prison. The background has some
        vegetation which may have been used to soften the image.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is an information
        sign from the Queensland Government. The information about who
        died and how is about prisoners buried in the prisoner cemetery.
        A prisoner by the name of Thomas Stapleton is used as an
        example. Prisoner crosses can be seen behind the sign, and the
        sign appears to be inside the white picket fence surrounding the
        cemetery.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is a coloured information board, grass, a white picket
        fence, and cement crosses.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten, and
        learn about the prisoners cemetery.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern. The photo is coloured and clear. It
        must be post-December 1998 because the Queensland Parks and
        Wildlife Service was created (Queensland State Archives n.d.),
        and their name is on the board

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The sign is the focus.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is an infographic
        information board. I can see it was issued by the Queensland
        Government. There is a little information about the prison,
        dates, and a map or plan of where key features can be found.
        They are clearly labelled and numbered, with a little
        information about each. The map shows the outline of the
        original prison, what is left, and where roads are/were located.
        I think it is a great way to show the before and after. I’m a
        visual person so it's great for me.

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a cross in a
        cemetery. The only identifying feature is a number, 574. No
        name, no age, no date of birth, or death date is shown. There
        are other crosses in the background which look to be identical.
        A white picket fence is in the background with an unrelated person.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        This is a cement cross in a cemetery. It has only the number
        574. No name, no age, no date of birth, or death date is shown.
        There are other crosses in the background which look to be
        identical. A white picket fence is in the background with an
        unrelated person.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten and
        learn about life on St Helena. It could have also been taken to
        show the discrepancy in accounts of the crosses.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern. Its coloured and clear. The crosses
        date to post 1928 as the crosses have been cement, with only
        numbers since at least 1928 (Unknown 7 April 1928). They were
        however made of timber, with identifying details such as name,
        age, and prisoner number in 1878 (Unknown 20 March 1878).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The cross in the foreground shows the prisoner’s number. There
        are other crosses in the background to show it is not alone. I
        think the photo is trying to make the scene less sombre.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it is a peaceful,
        tranquil setting.The colours are boring to me, it seems a little
        dull.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is a dense forest with a small cluster of palm trees.
        There is water and sand.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I cannot say what the context is. It is just a picture of a
        shore. There are no details to establish the purpose of the shot.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is neither. It is a painting so could be an image from the
        artist’s imagination, not necessarily a real place.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        I think it is an old painting. The colour of the edging looks
        old. It looks to have slight damage as well. The writing in the
        bottom right does not look modern.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        Sand, water, trees, and palms are in the foreground. Possibly to
        convey a beachy, tranquil scene. In the background are dense
        trees conveying that it is untouched, with no human contact.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that the area around the
        brick building looks unkept, and I feel a little chaotic. I
        think this is a place of industry because of the large chimney
        and large circular item bottom center.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There’s a brick building, a large brick chimney, a circular
        industrial piece, a wall, and bushes with dead limbs and rubble.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To show the sugar mill. I am not sure if this is the first or
        the second sugar mill, however, if it was the first one built,
        it was the first sugar mill built in QLD, so it is historic
        (Snow 1 November 1935).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is hard to tell, it could be both.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        I cannot tell from this picture, except for maybe the round
        cylindrical item but I don’t know what it is.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        It looks as though the vegetation is starting to grow up around
        the building and there is rubble and branches in the foreground.
        The mill and its components have all been framed in the shot.

              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that the men are in a
        large wooden barn with windows near the roof. The men are
        sitting on the benches lining the barn, with similar clothes on,
        a uniform. I can make out numbers on the back of some men’s
        shirts. All the men in white are facing away from the camera.
        Men in dark clothes look at, and pose for, the camera. A smartly
        dressed man, in a bowler hat, three-piece suit, and cane/stick,
        poses halfway down the building. Another two figures stand in
        the distance, wearing dark clothes. A man in dark clothes in the
        foreground and to the right appears to be wearing an old police
        or military uniform. One of the people using a sewing machine is
        wearing dark clothes, and I think has hair up in a bun. Why
        would one woman be among all men, wearing different clothes?

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is an old iron, cloth or fabric bundles, prisoners, a
        warder, a smartly dressed man. There is a lot of fabric/cloth
        hanging from beams, an old-style iron on the table, and a row of
        early sewing machines, so these men must be tailors.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To report back or promote the work that the prisoners are doing.
        Free labour, making a profit for the penal establishment,
        everything, right down to making police uniforms (Whittington 13
        February 2021). Propaganda for budgets. It shows men working,
        not just sitting in cells, and they are not shackled up, which
        could be trying to show reformation is working.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        I think it’s staged, as the smartly dressed man is standing,
        waiting for the photo to be taken. The men are all sitting,
        staring straight ahead, and look to be too close together to be
        working.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        I think the image is from around the late 1800s to just after
        the turn of the century. The man has a bowler hat on, carries a
        cane/stick, and is wearing a three-piece suit. He is wearing
        fashion from around the 1870s (Matthews 2016) and is sporting a
        moustache that fits the time period. there are no lights hanging
        from the roof. I say before or around 1882 because electricity
        was supplied to Brisbane in 1882 (Scholz Electrical 2021).

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        There are some tools and cloth in the foreground. The sewing
        machines are made prominent, placed in the centre of the picture.

        The Black Napoleon

    Type 	Artwork
    Artist 	Megan Cope
    Abstract 	The story of the Black Napoleon is just one of the many
    stories of powerful and clever people defying Empire at the turn of
    the 19th and 20th century throughout Australia. There are many
    recorded stories about the man that the British forces referred to
    as the Black Napoleon, also recorded as Eulope, the reason for his
    name Napoleon is interesting to me and changes over time throughout
    the echoes in the colonial press, some say he bore his name from his
    striking resemblance to Bonaparte but it most likely came about from
    his leadership in the resistance battles against British forces
    during invasion of Quandamooka country.

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that I find the image
        appealing. The shades of blue used are beautiful. The contrast
        with the shaded figure really draws my eyes. For me, the blue
        represents water, there are bubbles coming from the highest blue
        section. There are also Dolphins/sharks/whales depicted at the
        bottom of the image. Looking at the paint on his torso I almost
        see it become waves, or swell, of the ocean. The Black Napoleon
        looks strong and confident. He looks like a warrior.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        The handsome Indigenous figure (assuming from the title) is
        wearing a headdress and body paint. A shell hangs around his
        neck and a bar/stick is through his nose. He is wearing body paint.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        As part of the French Connection project by Megan Cope (Cope
        2019). Eulope of the Quandamooka people of Stradbroke Island,
        was said to resemble Napoleon Bonaparte (Kerkhove n.d.), so when
        he was exiled to an island, known as Noogoon, it was jokingly
        called St Helena, but it stuck. Eulope is The Black Napoleon.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is a work of art.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It is contemporary

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The focus is the figure, but there are other features, such as;
        the blue represents water, and there are bubbles coming from the
        highest blue section. There are also Dolphins/sharks/whales
        depicted at the bottom of the image. Looking at the paint on his
        torso I almost see it become waves, or swell, of the ocean. The
        Black Napoleon looks strong and confident. He looks like a warrior.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that this is a farm scene.
        The man is watering by hand which seems strange given the large
        area. There are different things being grown, or at separate
        phases of their growth. Everything in the image looks clean,
        tidy, and organised. I feel like there are a lot of straight lines.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        I cannot tell if the building has two chimneys or if they may in
        fact be church steeples. There is a prisoner, paddocks with
        crops growing, some trees, and a watering can.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        I think it’s taken to show off the crops and space the penal
        establishment has. May be used as propaganda for budgets. The
        prisoner is not shackled so it may also be displaying that
        reformation is working. May be showing the success of the penal
        establishment at being self-sufficient, growing corn, potatoes,
        lucerne, and vegetables (Bull 1 January 1960).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        I think it is spontaneous. It would be hard in early photography
        to have the water falling from the watering can for the entire
        shot on call. The prisoner also is standing casually. Then again
        it may not be a prisoner, but rather a warder dressed as a
        prisoner for the photo.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        It is hard to tell, there is little to use as a measure.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The crops and the prisoner are in the foreground, showing the
        success of the penal establishment. The building in the
        background may be to show how much space the prisoners are given.

          Notes:

      o


              Initial reflection

        My initial response to this image is: that it reminds me of a
        picture you see from WWI battles, like the Somme. It feels
        devoid of life, the black and white of the image makes it appear
        worse, I think. The only indication of habitation is the two
        buildings. From the stumps of the trees, you can see that there
        had been a dense area of trees. If I didn’t know what the photo
        was for, I would ask why the trees are being cleared.

      o


              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There are tree stumps, trees, and two buildings.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        Could have been taken to show the progress of clearing, or to
        convey how much hard work has been done.

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It could have been both, either taken at will or set up on a tripod.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        I think it is an old picture. It has the look of early
        photography. The way it is damaged is another clue. Also, the
        design of the building.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        Almost bare earth and tree stumps are in the foreground. Tall –
        alive- trees are in the background, with two buildings. The
        stumps in the foreground makes them the focus of the image.

        replica, from prisoner 56, and is labelled as a carpenter’s
        shop. The bench is full of tools used by the prisoners. Each
        tool has its place stencilled on the board to make missing tools
        noticeable. There is a saddle, pictures, and a hand drill on the
        wall. There is also a stool and a grinding wheel.

              Structured reflection

        _What objects or physical features are in the image?_

        There is a reproduced workstation, belonging to prisoner 56, and
        is labelled as a carpenter’s shop. The bench is full of tools
        used by the prisoners. Each tool has its place stencilled on the
        board.. There is a saddle, pictures, and a hand drill on the
        wall. There is also a stool and a grinding wheel.

        _What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?_

        To share with others and make sure history is not forgotten and
        learn about life in the prison. It shows how the prisoners
        worked in the workshops, the tools they had, or did not have. It
        shows what kind of skills they were learning which they would
        have on release (Queensland Government 2015).

        _Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?_

        It is spontaneous, as a person was walking on a tour, and the
        items have been arranged as a exhibit.

        _Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give
        you that information?_

        The photo itself is modern but the tools shown are very old. The
        hand drill indicates that it may have been before electricity.

        _How is the image composed? What is in the background, and what
        is in the foreground?_

        The items in the display are the focus. The photo has been taken
        in an attempt to capture them all.
