BRISBANE GAOL FULL. CONVICTED SEAMEN. ST. HELENA BEING USED. BRISBANE,
September 23. With the excess of prisoners due to the conviction of seamen in connec-tion with the
current strike the Bris-bane Gaol has become full to over-flowing, and to relieve the congestion the prison
authorities have arranged to send a number of the men to St. Helena. The first batch of forty or fifty men
will be sent to St. Helena to-morrow. A statement was current to-day that union and Trades Hall authori-
ties intended to protest strongly against these men being sent to the island, holding that it was an estab-
lishment for penal offences. It has been pointed out, however, that St. Helena, which can accommo-date
about 300 prisoners, really Is be-ing used for first offenders - not men of the criminal type - and that it is
conducted on the honour system, the men being allowed a large measure of freedom. It is understood that
summonses have been issued against about 650 seamen.
