BRISBANE NOTES.

(From our own Correspondent.

The joke of the week.

The joke of the week has undoubtedly

been the discovery of the convicts who were supposed to have escaped from St. Helena, on the island
itself right under the very nose of the authorities, where they had been for the previous 12 days and nights,
while the police and detective forces were searching Bribie Passage, the islands and the coast-line
generally. The news of

the discovery was at first, received with incredulity, but when confirmation came the joke which had been
unintentionally perpetrated at the expense of the police naturally aroused considerable comment of a
humorous as well as a vigorous character. St. Helena has a total coast-line of three miles and a length of 1
1/4 miles, and the fact, that two escaped prisoners could re-main hidden there for nearly a fortnight, in
spite of the difficulty of obtaining food supplies, has naturally aroused suspicion, especially as the
conditions of life at the penal establishment have already the repu-tation of being anything but strict. At
time of writing a departmental inquiry was being held, and the probabilities are that the in-vestigation may
go still further.
