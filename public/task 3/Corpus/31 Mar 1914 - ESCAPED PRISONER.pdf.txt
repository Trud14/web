ESCAPED PRISONER

IN A WEAK CONDITION

Adrift on a plank.

Brisbane, March 30.

The convict Hamilton, who disappeared from St Helena Island Prison last Thurs-day evening, was
recaptured at about 11 o'clock yesterday morning. A warder, on duty, had his attention attracted by an
object floating in the sea several hun-dred yards distant from the shore of the island, in the direction of the
boat pas-sage. He immediately reported the mat-ter to his chief, and the prison launch, manned by a
number of warders, put out

to sea and was soon heading towards the

floating object.

As the launch drew closer it was no-ticed that the object was almost sub-merged. On it was the body of a
man

which was almost under the water. When

the launch drew alongside the man was discovered to be Hamilton, the escaped convict. He was still
dressed in prison garb and he was secured by the warders and placed on board the launch without any
resistance. In fact, he was in too weak a condition, from the exposure and want of food, to resist. The
object he was floating on was taken in tow and the party returned to the island, where the floating object
was discovered to consist of two long forms, lashed together.
