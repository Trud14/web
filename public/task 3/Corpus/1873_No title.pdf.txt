         It appears  that        ?


                                     the   alarm     raised at St.
       Helena on Tuesday                  caused
                                 was                 by two abori
       ginal convicts rushing from the
                                                    gang in which
       ihev were       working, and       concealing themselves
       in a clump of cane.
                                     They would not answer
       to the repeated calls of the warders, so that the
          alarm       was   given and a search for the fugi
       tives commenced.            The gangs       at work     in the
       fields and     in the boiling-house          were    marched
       to their quarters, and         the whole force at the
       disposal of the Superintendent, Mr. M 'Donald,
       was    directed to the capture           of the runaways,
       Wa'cbes       were    also set to prevent them escap
       ing from^ the island. Up to last night, how
       ever, no intelligence had            been received at the
       Brisbane Police-office of the capture of the
       escapees.        The    men    are    named       Sandy and
       Johnny respectively, the former undergoing a
       life sentence       for a criminal assault on a woman
       on    the Gympie road to Maryborough, and the
       latter a senteuce of seven years' penal servitude
       for abetting in the crime.               It has transpired
       that     on
                    Monday night the two aboriginals in
       formed       another     prisoner of their intention to
       bolt, stating that
                                 they intended to hide^D the
       cane      until night, and         then    swim     Tfom the
       island to the main            land.     It is not unlikely
       they have succeeded in their design, unless the
       sharks  have   interfered   to prevent it being
       carried to a successful issue.  Conner.
