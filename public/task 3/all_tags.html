<p>mangrove swamp, were not missed until, about ten minutes to 5, when the gang mustered for return to the stockade.</p>

    <p>younger of the two gaol-breakers was found in the mud, wet and hungry, about 7 o’clock, and created a good deal of amusement, on being returned to the stockade, by demanding, “Where’s MY</p>
<p>HOMINY?” The other, a more experienced bushman, was at large until nearly midnight. He got into the water, and remained concealed there, his head hidden by the overhanging branches of a mangrove tree, until he thought he mightly safely</p>
<p> </p>
<p>venture forth. His plan was to get one of the horses, and by its aid swim the shark-infested channel to the mainland. The plan miscarried, owing to all the horses having been stabled, as soon as the alarm was given. As he approached the stable-door, he found himself look-, ing down the barrel of a rifle steadily poised in the hands of a warder.</p>

    <p>There was a prisoner in St. Helena who was employed as chief cook. He robbed the invalids in the hospital of their food, and stole the prisoners’ tea and sold it to th warders. He also MIXED FLOUR WITH THE OATMEAL which the doctor had ordered for some of the</p>
<p>prisoners in the yards. One morning the prisoners complained to the chief war-der that flour was mixed with their oatmeal. The chief warder immediately sent for the chief cook prisoner and told him</p>
<p> </p>
<p>he had mixed flour with the prisoners’ oatmeal. Of course the prisoner denied it, and told the chief warder that he would prove that the oatmeal was not adulter-ated, by showing some raw oatmeal which was in the kitchen. “All right,” said the chief warder, “and then I will believe you.” The prisoner then proceeded to the kitchen and shortly afterwards returned with a bag half full of oatmeal. “Give it to me,” said the chief warder, and, continuing, “now I am certain that you mixed flour with the oatmeal, because you should not have any oatmeal before the rations are issued for the day. The very fact of your having oatmeal before the issue of the rations is proof positive that the prisoners did not receive for tea and breakfast what the doctor had ordered them.” </p>

    <p>There is a prisoner at the island who used to buy up all the socks, braces, towels, etc., that he could. For a quarter stick of tobacco, the value of which is about twopence, he used to purchase SOCKS WORTH A SHILLING a pair. For braces which cost 2s, 6d. he</p>
<p>would give three-quarters of a plug. A warder used to supply him with tobacco. He gave the things which he had bought to the warder after he had removed the brands which are put on them when they arrive at St. Helena. The warder allowed him a commission on all he bought. Our correspondent says he firmly believes that the authorities knew that this most de-spicable form of collusion was being carried on, because he had been assured that a prisoner had reported it. </p>

    <p>In one of these channels, on the south-east side of the island, a buoy is fastened, and a barge, a rickety-looking concern, is anchored-it looks all ready to sink. From hence the landing is made. Boats sent off from the island and the boats of the steamer take the passengers into shallow water, where they are met by spring-carts and drays, and taken ashore. A jetty is being built of conglomerate stone, found on the island, which will simplify the landing process. This jetty is a heavy work, owing to the great length it has to be carried out (some 1800 feet), ere deep water is reached.</p>

Years of use, in rough hands generally, have shaken them badly. The works are mostly of travels, and of the order instructive, with a few of the mildest kind of novels. There is quite a demand for this literature, and an extension of the collection seems amongst the things desirable for St. Helena. </p>

    <p>Recently a large force of men was engaged making netting for kangaroo traps. This netting is made of strong rope. It is of sufficient height to prevent a kangaroo jumping over it, and the intention is to fasten the netting to trees and stakes in the form of yards, and then drive the kangaroos in the usual way. Some 1000 yards have been made, but the supply of rope has given out, and there is a stoppage in consequence. The intention is to have about three miles of netting, and to move it about and arrange it in places where effective kangaroo drives can be made. This netting is for a kangaroo association in the north. </p>

Then “Silence” is ordered, after which any talking or noise up to the time of the morning bell is punish-able. </p>

    <p>bedding consists of three half-blankets. Except in the observation cells, once locked up, a man is entirely private and cannot be spied on from the outside. Cells and wards are arranged on either side of a brightly-lit passage, along which the warders patrol at night. In each ward are twelve men, six on each side, three above and three below, a narrow passage running up the centre, and an oil drum for a night-bucket stands at the head of the passage. The hammocks are slung from the walls and TWO IRON BARS. These bars form the passageway. </p>

Then what is to go to the prisoners is chopped up for the messes according to scale, under the supervision of the warder in charge and chief cook. It is put into nets, THROWN INTO A BARROW and wheeled to tho kitchen, where seven convict cooks are employed. There it is generally boiled, and the cooks can take what they want for themselves and their pals, as the warder in charge never sees the meat cooked. When cooked, the warder in charge sees it put on the trollies for the yards. </p>

    <p>men constantly complain of short weight. They take the meat up, and it is weighed, and a ration has been found to scale only 8oz., bone included, instead of 16. This reduction in weight is said to be due to cooking, that is all the satisfaction the men get. If the meat is bad — that is, so bad as to be noticeable, charcoal is thrown into the boiler. This has the effect of taking the smell away, but of course does not affect the QUALITY OF THE MEAT If, however, the men take the meat to the superintendent with a complaint, he simply sniffs it, says “there’s no smell,” and the men are sent away without any redress. </p>

    <p>In 1853 a Brisbane judge commented on the conditions in Sydney’s Cockatoo Island prison:</p>
<p>‘It was a painful consideration that the punishment at Cockatoo was felt ten times more severely by the blacks than by the whites, and most of them die. Recently, one who had sentence of death commuted, and was sent there, suffered most acutely, and died in seven weeks. But there appeared no alternative, for if they were sent to the gaol here, or to the Newcastle breakwater, they would very probably escape.’ (Moreton Bay Free Press, 29 November 1853)</p>

    <p>1846 when the New South Wales government decided to convert a former convict building on Queen Street into a prison. However, only £820 was allocated to construct the prison, as compared to the £13,000 that had been spent on Sydney’s Darlinghurst Gaol in 1841. In the same week that the new Brisbane prison opened, it was described in the Moreton Bay Courier on 5 January 1850 as being ‘not sufficiently secure’ due to careless workmanship. The decaying porphyry-block structure was repeatedly criticised throughout the 1850s as being too small, rickety, and out-of-date with new penological trends. Plans for a new gaol were delayed by the ongoing uncertainty over Separation, with the New South Wales government unwilling to spend freely in what might soon be a separate colony.</p>

<p>St. Helena was a great camping place for them [flying fox]</p>
<p>in those days, and the blacks from Wynnum used to go across</p>
<p>in their canoes to catch them there, watching for calm weather</p>

In fact the Home Secretary states that with re-gard to prison reform in connection with St. Helena prison, his officers have in-formed him that the whole temper of the prisoners has changed since the initiation of the new system. Great improvement in their conduct, and in the way in which they were devoting themselves to their respective prison occupations has been noted and recorded. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>A prison is a building that has been officially proclaimed as an incarceration facility. A ‘penal</p>
<p>establishment’ includes all the surrounding land. St Helena was actually proclaimed to be a high-security</p>
<p>‘gaol, prison, and house of correction’ for long-term inmates on November 1875, before again being</p>
<p>proclaimed a Penal Establishment in July 1879.</p>

<p>been constructed in 1869 by prisoners incarcerated on the island. They needed to create lime to</p>

    <p>process for lime burning in kilns was the same:</p>


<h2>1. Collect or quarry the base product</h2>
<p>2. Stack the limestone or coral/shells and firewood cut from the nearby forests in layers inside the</p>
<p>kiln funnel. Light this and keep burning for days or weeks at a time, adding more firewood and</p>
<p>limestone/coral as the burning progresses.</p>
<p>3. Lime produced dropped to the base of the funnel where it was shovelled out of the small</p>
<p>opening by a worker.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An account from Waratah in 1902 describes the final part of the process:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“All the fuel had been completely burnt, and the man each time drew out a shovelful of lime and</p>
<p>emptied it onto a bag fixed on a frame beside him. As each bag was filled, he wheeled it away,</p>

    <p>The early years saw prisoners clearing native vegetation, planting crops and constructing buildings. The island’s resources were used wherever possible - buildings were constructed from sandstone blocks quarried from the southern flats and bricks moulded from island clay mixes. A lime kiln was constructed to burn coral for cement.</p>
<p>Maize and vegetable crops, supplemented with sheep and cattle herds, provided much of the island residents’ food requirements. The most successful island produce included sugar cane and award-winning Ayrshire dairy cattle. Olive oil produced from the island’s olive groves also won prizes in Italy.</p>

    <p>Eulope, the Turrwan (or chieftain) of the Nunakal clan of the Quandamooka (Moreton Bay) people, resisted the European intruders when they arrived at Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island. As Eulope’s physical stature was similar to that of the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, Eulope became known among the British military as “Napoleon”. As the fable goes, in 1827, Napoleon of Stradbroke Island “borrowed” a steel axe in Dunwich and was exiled to Noogoon for his crime. Henceforth, the island became known as St Helena, the name of the exile home of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

The most successful outcomes were the sugar cane, the growing of olives, and the prize-winning Ayrshire dairy herd, introduced in 1892.</p>

The establishment of a heritage register in 1992 combined with nearly 20 years of assessment has amounted to 179 places entered in the register with historical archaeological values of significance to Queensland. While the requirement to obtain a permit to undertake historical archaeological surveys and most excavations was repealed in 2008 many assessments continue to identify historical archaeological</p>

    <p>When the time comes for a review of the Queensland Heritage Act, what constitutes “best practice” in historical archaeology today must of course be the ultimate goal though it must be acknowledged that some compromises will likely be made. For example, several amendments made to the Queensland Heritage Act in recent times have not resulted in improvements to archaeological practice and even weakened the situation. The requirement for practitioners to seek government approval for historical archaeological survey and excavation was removed in 2008. Ever since then potentially destructive work has been carried out with limited regulatory supervision. On the other hand, some temporary protection was added for previously unrecorded archaeological sites located during the course of development or other ground disturbing works. This requirement, however, is fundamentally flawed and relies on those with the least to gain from compliance with the legislation (i.e. a developer or someone hunting historic artifacts for profit such as a bottle collector) to admit they have found or even destroyed important archaeological evidence. Recent changes to legislative requirements in other Australian jurisdictions, such as in New South Wales, have arguably weakened the ability to protect important places and this should act as a warning. Legislation has been and will continue to be developed in reference to political motivations that do not necessarily correlate with the wishes and desires of the archaeological community.</p>

    <p>A search of comparable registers across Australia shows that Queensland is in this way performing well in the protection of historical archaeological places through their identification, significance assessment and registration on the State heritage register (Fig. 2). Since 2003, an average of seven places with historical archaeological values has been added to the Queensland heritage register each year, averaging about 17 % of annual registrations. This is close to double the average number added in the preceding decade. The main reason behind the increase is the addition of a specific archaeological place category to the register in 2008. Since then 14 places have been entered specifically for their historical archaeological values. Queensland also recog-nizes that archaeology is not just a compliance related activity and proactive identification and assessment programs for historical archaeological places have been undertaken in some parts of the State.</p>

    <p>The heritage register is also far from representative of the full range of historical archaeological place types that are known to survive in Queensland. The majority of entries relate to Queensland’s mining heritage, including remnants of the prolific gold, tin, copper, silver, and rare metals industries of central and north Queensland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Fig. 4). Their recognition is due to a number of studies on the mining theme initiated by the Queensland Government during the 1990s rather than any deliberate effort to protect such places (Jane Lennon and Associates and Pearce 1996; Kerr 1992; Pearson 1994).</p>

    <p>general public is overtly concerned about “historic architecture” and “irreplaceable” heritage places, such as national icons, with no recognition given to the wide range of archaeological resources found throughout the country (McDonald 2006, p. 9). This ignorance of archaeological values is particularly the case where the archaeological record has been created well within living memory, where the primacy of detailed documentation and oral accounts leads the public to believe that archaeological examination of the physical environment is costly and pointless.</p>

Recent discussions about the future of Australia’s heritage programs also continue to promote the nation’s tangible heritage as revolving around the “built and natural environments” with little recognition of the existence of archaeological phenomena (Spearitt 2011).</p>

    <p>McDonald became Keeper of the Hulk Proserpine (128) on 18 May 1864, and for which he was appointed Gaoler of this prison hulk on 1 June 1865. (129) In this transmission from Police, Water Police, to Gaoler of the prison hulk Proserpine, McDonald became intimately associated with the establishment of the Penal Establishment on St Helena Island during 1866-67. In assessing the initial stages of building and works on the island, the Colonial Architect relayed in early 1867:</p>
<p>Some eighteen prisoners had been employed on the Island of St Helena from</p>
<p>February 1866, first in the erection of a Lockup, and latterly in the</p>
<p>construction of the two buildings, under the supervision of a Foreman of</p>
<p>Carpenters, assisted by one freeman for the better joiner’s work, the</p>
<p>prisoners passing backwards and forward to the Hulk `Proserpine’ anchored</p>
<p>off Fisherman’s Island, some four or five miles distant, until within the</p>
<p>last two months [November 1866], when the Hulk was removed to an anchorage</p>
<p>nearer the Island in order to allow the full compliment of prisoners to be</p>
<p>put to work at the new Convict depot, in finishing the buildings above</p>
<p>mentioned, clearing the scrub, and completing a jetty near the Lockup.</p>

    <p>The Colonial Architect’s report dated 10 January 1867, indicates some building construction had already taken place on St Helena as the island was initially intended to become a Quarantine Station. With the `project of making St Helena a Quarantine Station being abandoned’ these buildings were converted `into convict buildings’ so as `to meet the demand for extra prison accommodation’ when it was decided to instead use the St Helena for that purpose. (134) This report also included details on the proposed accommodation on the eastern side of the island of the Military Guard who were shortly expected to commence duties:</p>
<p>The prisoners are now engaged on these works and one of the buildings, that</p>
<p>on the West Side of the bluff, will be ready for the reception of about 60</p>
<p>prisoners in the course of a week … but as it is the intention of the</p>
<p>Government to put a military guard over the prisoners on St Helena, and no</p>
<p>shelter being as yet available, the prison wards cannot be used until the</p>
<p>building on the East bank has been temporarily fitted up for the reception</p>
<p>of the guard, and this cannot be finished for some three or four weeks to</p>
<p>come, as the roof is not yet on the building, and the work being done by</p>
<p>prisoners, a longer time is required than if it were being done by free</p>

    <p>Privates of the 50th who would serve as part of the Military Guard were also provided with lengthy and detailed `General Instructions’ for their</p>
<p>guidance. (138)</p>
<p>The formalisation of procedures and instructions for both NCOs and Privates serving in the Military Guard appear to have been at least partially instituted following complaints by Superintendent John McDonald about the manner these Soldiers were carrying out their tasks to the perceived detriment of operations of the Penal Establishment.</p>
<p>On 31 October 1867, McDonald outlined to the Colonial Secretary:</p>
<p>I have … [found] fault on several occasions with the manner in which some</p>
<p>of the military guard performed their Duties … and more especially when</p>
<p>on the points of landing. That orders on that post, or part of the orders</p>
<p>is not to allow any person to land without the written order of the</p>
<p>Colonial Secretary or Visiting Justice. But some of the military do not pay</p>
<p>the slightest attention to the above order and their attention has been</p>
<p>especially called to the part of their orders by the NCO in charge of the</p>
<p>guard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On several occasions persons have been allowed to land from the steamer</p>
<p>`Kate’ without the sentries demanding their authority and allowed to pass</p>
<p>to the prison, the consequence is that anything might be passed to the</p>
<p>prisoners at work all over the island. It is necessary that the above order</p>
<p>should be strictly carried out; there is another matter I should bring</p>
<p>before your notice, viz, of sending Lance Corporals in charge of the guard</p>
<p>who do not appear to have the least control over their men which is not the</p>
<p>case with a full Sergeant or full Corporal. I think if the matter was</p>
<p>brought before the notice of the Capt. Commanding the troops, that he would</p>
<p>cause the duties to be more satisfactorily performed in future. (139)</p>
<p>Shortly after McDonald again followed up his concerns with another complaint about the behaviour of the Guard in December 1867:</p>
<p>I had to complain to the visiting justice of the careless manner in which</p>
<p>the military guard perform their duties. [This?] month I found soldiers</p>
<p>while on guard talking with prisoners, and on one occasion I found one of</p>
<p>them sitting down reading a book while on prison guard, there seems to be a</p>
<p>great lack of discipline amongst the guard, as a rule, I have reason to</p>
<p>believe that the guard conveys letters to and from prisoners on the island,</p>
<p>and the prisoners are kept as well informed of all passing events as if</p>
<p>they were in Brisbane Gaol! While such conduct amongst the guard which I</p>
<p>have to depend so much upon, is allowed to be carried on, what confidence</p>

    <p>1 February 1868, Superintendent McDonald reported to the Colonial Secretary that the `large prison building’ under construction was expected to be completed by the end of March. Once this building was ready this would allow for the accommodation for 150 prisoners on St Helena. McDonald again used this forum of his regular report as an opportunity to again complain about the Military Guard, suggesting in the process, Warders be used to replace them:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the prisoners are increased to the above number the number of warders</p>
<p>will also have to increase, there ought to be one warder for every ten …</p>
<p>prisoners together with the military guard as at present established on the</p>
<p>island. I would recommend that three warders be substituted for the</p>
<p>military guard. The guard is of no service in charge of prisoners at work</p>
<p>as they do not take the slightest interest, and pay little or no attention</p>
<p>the orders I give them; and as a rule they make free with the prisoners, so</p>
<p>that it is impossible to carry out the same discipline that could be</p>
<p>carried out with warders. (142)</p>

    <p>soldiers of the Military Guard were for all intents and purposes, as isolated on St Helena as the prisoners they were expected to guard. Being selected to make up the personnel for mounting this Military Guard no doubt was highly unpopular within the ranks of Brisbane’s 50th garrison. Those men selected had to contend with not only the isolation but also the strict regime of the prison administration and operation. When combined with general dissatisfaction at their placement, some of these soldiers quite naturally adversely reacted to their surrounds and duties — earning in the process the ire of Superintendent McDonald. The soldiers who made up this small Military Guard also quickly found that life on St Helena was a far cry from the facilities, opportunities and pleasures garrison life in Brisbane offered.</p>

    <p>For those soldiers who were tasked with service on St Helena — they too had complaints of their own regarding the conditions of their accommodation and the rations they were expected to tolerate. On 3 March 1868, Lieutenant MacGregor, 50th Regiment, temporarily `Commanding Troops’, wrote to the Queensland Colonial Secretary about certain grievances of the men who had served in the Military Guard detachment:</p>
<p>I have the honour to bring to your notice the aged and dirty state of the</p>
<p>beds provided for the military guard at St. Helena, and beg to request that</p>
<p>you will cause the proper authorities to provide new ones at once. There</p>

    <p>On 17 June 1868, Captain Eden, the officer now commanding the 50th Regiment detachment in Brisbane, in a detailed correspondence, also brought a variety of complaints of the men of the Military Guard before the Colonial Secretary.</p>
<p>With a view to its receiving your early attention I … bring to your</p>
<p>notice that the Detachment 50th Regt, last returned from St. Helena … on</p>
<p>the 8th Inst. complain in a body of the inferior quality of the rations</p>
<p>issued to them at that station. I understand them to say among other things</p>
<p>that for the space of their days they had no Bread whatever, and that no</p>
<p>potatoes were issued to them for, I think, a period of eight days. I am</p>
<p>informed that in the first case a certain quantity of some description of</p>
<p>flour was presented to them, in place of Bread with a suggestion that they</p>
<p>could make their own … The scale for the Issue of Rations to the Troops</p>
<p>at St Helena, if I remember right, was authorized by yourself, and provides</p>
<p>for a daily portion of bread and potatoes for the soldiers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I also … bring to your notice a pretty general complaint from the</p>
<p> </p>
<p>soldiers (and noncomd. Officers in charge) that have of late been stationed</p>
<p>at St Helena regarding Mr. Turnkey Hamilton, who, by the way, I understand</p>
<p>to be the Issuer above alluded to — his manner to them they designate as</p>
<p>most irritating and annoying …</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can quite believe this complaint to be exaggerated by irritation, still,</p>
<p>judging from the well known character of many of my informants, I am</p>
<p>convinced that it contains sufficient grounds to warrant … the attention</p>
<p>you may find it to deserve. (144)</p>

    <p>complaints raised by the men were of offensive language or manner of the Chief Warder, James Hamilton, towards them; `the total, or partial absence of Sentry Boxes’ for the protection of sentries during inclement weather; and `great complaints concerning an offensive cesspool’ located near one guard post. But it was the actual duties that these soldiers were expected to perform, and the numbers of men from the Military Guard used as sentries at any one time that was also of concern to Captain Eden:</p>
<p>… the fact that they are a great deal to arms, and, as I rather think,</p>
<p>not sanctioned by the `Queens Regulations’. With respect to this I</p>
<p>mentioned my objection to Mr Superintendent Macdonald, stating I could not</p>
<p>allow the use of five sentries from a guard of but eleven effective men. My</p>
<p>objection appears to have had no use yet with him, for I have ascertained</p>
<p>that he regards the military Regulations, as expressed through me, with no</p>
<p>attention whatever, and still continues to employ more sentries than the</p>
<p>Guard can properly furnish. (145)</p>

    <p>another aspect to the role of the Military Guard on St Helena was the unenviable position in which soldiers might at any time find themselves called upon the fire on prisoners. Such a situation was a glaring potential conflict between Army and civil jurisdiction, as it was liability in case of death or injury that might be inflicted by a soldier. Such a situation was a glaring potential conflict between military and civil jurisdiction since whatever action a soldier took in performing his duty which may have resulted in the death or injury of a prisoner did not exempt him from prosecution under either codes of law. In June 1868, Captain Eden requested through Visiting Justice Barron, that the `instructions for the guidance of the Military Guard’ be amended by the Government so as to provide more detail than those already in use on St Helena. After receiving the Government’s response, Captain Eden replied on 16 June:</p>
<p>I believe it to be necessary, before these instructions can be put in</p>
<p>force, that some addition to them should be made, that shall regard the</p>
<p>necessity for using the loaded Rifles put into the soldiers hands, and</p>
<p>explicitly set down when, and from whom an order to fire on a `prisoner’</p>
<p>shall be considered valid, and an exemption from any ulterior consequences</p>
<p>that might arise out of such as act, the result of which was the wounding</p>
<p>or death of a Prisoner. I am convinced that some rule providing for an</p>
<p>emergency of this sort should be laid down and thus tend towards the</p>
<p>greater efficiency of the St Helena Detachment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rule No.11, of `General Instructions’ only forbids the discharge of a Rifle</p>
<p>without the Superintendents sanction with a view to prevent any false</p>
<p>alarm, and, consequently, denies the Soldier that means of giving warning</p>
<p>when a real alarm is necessary, which, it is to be presumed, may occur</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[soon?] at St. Helena. (146)</p>

    <p>In 1827 Eulope apparently threw a spear at a prison guard and stole a steel axe from Dunwich, a second military post on Stradbroke Island. As punishment, and</p>
<p>because the Dunwich soldiery had noted his rebellious tendencies, Captain Patrick Logan exiled him to Noogoon, an uninhabited island in Moreton Bay. In various</p>
<p>letters, Logan began referring to Noogoon as ‘St Helena’ in mocking reference to the place of Emperor Napoleon’s imprisonment. By the mid-nineteenth century, this</p>
<p>name was in regular use for the island.</p>

    <p>Unbeknown to Logan, Eulope’s imprisonment on Noogoon only lasted three days. Eulope knew the island very well, as it was a regular resort for his people for turtle</p>
<p>and flying fox hunting, and for harvesting tulipwood (used for spears). He ‘simply stripped a sheet of bark, sewed both ends, and paddled back to Stradbroke’ (Meston</p>
<p>1903, 8) where he was able to keep his identity hidden for a time. Various resistance activities were subsequently organised, probably by Eulope, culminating in the</p>
<p>Battle of ‘Narawai (near Moongalba) in around 1830 in which a dozen or so British soldiers and convicts were lured into swamps to fight Eulope’s warriors.</p>

    <p>Eulope was ‘cunning, elusive and of superb physique’ (Telegraph 1931, 12). He was so quick, wiry, muscular, and skilled that he regularly beat Aboriginal warriors</p>

    <p>Thinking detention on an ‘isolated’ island in the middle of Moreton Bay the best way to punish the ‘black Napoleon’, Commandant Logan exiled Eulope on Noogoon. However, Eulope spent less than three days on Noogoon making a bark canoe before paddling and navigating the signi&lt;U+FB01&gt;cant distance across the bay to his family on Stradbroke Island.27 Following this legendary act of de&lt;U+FB01&gt;ance, by 1848 the island was known to European settlers as St Helena.</p>

<p>Burketown Peter, a full-blooded [A]boriginal, escaped from his cell in January</p>
<p>1921, and put to sea in a raft of planks. He was seen and pursued. Diving from the</p>
<p>raft, he did not return to the surface and was probably taken by sharks.62 However, his cause of death remains uncertain, with later reports suggest that Kitikir had been shot while escaping, with the ‘son of a former warder on the island, cryptically, perhaps knowingly, stating: “I think he might have been despatched by other means”.’63</p>

<p>Flogging was reserved for extreme offences and was eventually replaced by incarceration in underground isolation cells.</p>

    <p>Under McDonald’s</p>
<p>care the prison was described by newspaper journalists as being of the highest standard with clean, healthy prisoners engaged in constructive</p>
<p>enterprises that provided them with excellent opportunities for self improvement. The aim of self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ciency was re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ected in the process by</p>
<p>which new prison buildings were constructed when they were needed. Plans were prepared by several long-serving prisoners to the</p>
<p>requirements of the Superintendent, the government architect not being employed. The materials were obtained on the island when possible.</p>

    <p>The scrub was not suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient to meet the demand for building timber, but the island stone and the lime extracted from neighbouring coral reefs</p>
<p>provided raw materials for many of the structures. The lime was burned in a kiln constructed on the island by 1869 using bricks and the local</p>
<p>stone. Later, when the sugar mill was operational, the lime produced was used for settling the vegetable matter suspended in the sugar syrup.</p>

    <p>One of the most successful early enterprises undertaken on the island was the growing and processing of sugar. McDonald trained himself in</p>
<p>the processes involved and the mill was considered something of a wonder in its own right. The crushing rollers were horse-driven and hand fed</p>
<p>by the prisoners. The syrup was gravity fed into vats for boiling down and crystallisation. The &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nal product was a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ne golden coloured sugar of</p>
<p>table quality which was used, not only by other government institutions, but was sold commercially. Both cane and sugar won many awards at</p>
<p>the annual International Exhibition. The cane served other useful functions on the island, the trash providing fuel for the warders’ &lt;U+FFFD&gt;res. </p>

    <p>Following Macdonald’s departure in</p>

<p>reduced even further, until in 1890 the prison commenced purchasing sugar from external sources. The sugar mill was converted into a laundry</p>
<p>and a herd of dairy cattle was introduced to provide milk, butter and cheese for the prison. </p>

    <p>A tramline had been constructed between the prison compound and the jetty in the late 1870s to move goods and raw materials. A series of</p>
<p>temporary lines were also laid down and relocated as required to transport everything from laundry to the nightsoil brought from the mainland</p>
<p>and buried in trenches on the island in the 1880s. A variety of rolling stock was used over the years including a two-handed pumper vehicle</p>
<p>similar to that used on railways. This was eventually superseded by a horse drawn tram car which operated for some thirty years. In the 1930s</p>
<p>the tramway fell into disrepair and the rails were removed, although much of the associated earthworks remain.</p>

    <p>By the early twentieth century conditions had changed once more under the superintendence of James Ryan and visitors to the island extolled</p>
<p>its virtues at length. It was described as the ‘pearl of Moreton Bay’ and ‘the garden of beauty’. Such descriptions aroused public interest and in</p>
<p>1912 a campaign was mounted by the Moreton Bay League for the closure of the prison and the conversion of the island into a place of public</p>
<p>recreation. The Government quashed this movement by announcing plans for a new, more substantial prison on St Helena, but this did not</p>
<p>proceed and in 1921 it was decided to close the prison and make the island a prison farm. Most of the inmates were removed to Boggo Road</p>
<p>Gaol and those who remained were occupied with the demolition of most of the gaol’s infrastructure, including fences, stockade walls,</p>
<p>workshops and other buildings.</p>

<p>Stradbroke Island. To solve this problem, Logan decided to relocate Napoleon,</p>

    <p>The First World War put a temporary halt to many public projects across the country, including prison reform. In 1921, however, the prison on the island of St Helena, off the coast of southern Queensland was converted to a prison farm.49 Officials at the time saw change on the island as part of the wave of reform from the south. There had been a large prison on the island since the 1860s, and as part of the conversion, the inmates were put to work dismantling the old cellblock buildings.</p>

    There is an interesting story behind the island’s name. In the early nineteenth century, it was briefly used as a place of confinement for an Aboriginal man who had repeatedly run foul of colonial officials. To British eyes, the man’s profile bore a resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte’s, so the island became known as St Helena, after the island on which the French leader was imprisoned.

He was an engineer by trade, and secured a berth as an engine hand on a steamer heading for London. He later said that after several years living a law-abiding life in England, he became ‘unhappy in the knowledge that I was a fugitive from justice and my varying fortunes convinced me that I would have been wiser to have served out the remaining four months of my sentence’.97 He returned to Australia, and, on 27 September 1934 gave himself up at Boggo Road Gaol. The superintendent recognised him and declared ‘Why, you’re John Stelling … I would have thought that this was the last place for you to visit’. Stelling replied: ‘Yes … I want to get this whole business over with. What do I have to do?’ He was officially released after serving the remaining four months plus an extra two and a half for the theft of the dingy and the destruction of the padlock on his cell door</p>

    <p>Eulope, the Turrwan or chieftain of the Nunakal clan of the Quandamooka</p>
<p>(Moreton Bay) people, had fought against the military when they arrived</p>
<p>at his homeland at Amity Point on North Stradbroke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of similar stature to the French emperor Napoleon Bonparte, he became</p>
<p>known among the British as Napoleon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 1827, Napoleon ďborrowedĒ a steel axe in Dunwich and was exiled to</p>
<p>Noogoon (ďplace of the &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ying foxĒ as it was called by the Quandamooka</p>
<p>people, or Green Island 2) for his crime.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It took him only three days to build a canoe and escape, but it was long</p>
<p>enough for the island to be called after St Helena, the island of</p>
<p>Napoleonís imprisonment in the South Atlantic.</p>

    <p>St Helena had commenced as a penal establishment in May 1867 and was described as ‘experimental’.53 Some longer term male prisoners were employed on the island in small-scale agriculture and land clearance, but there had always been uncertainty about the type of prisoner to be sent to St Helena, ‘trustworthy’ men or the worst long term cases.</p>

    <p>Decisions were made quickly. The dire condition of colonial finances, combined with concerns for maintaining discipline, settled the future of the penal system for the next fifty years. The government hoped that St Helena could become self-sustaining and perhaps profitable. A range of trades and workshops would be introduced, and for this able-bodied men, preferably with skills, were required. By the time of the report on St Helena (1869), the government’s view was that St Helena should become the premier penal establishment for men. Brisbane Gaol would process</p>
