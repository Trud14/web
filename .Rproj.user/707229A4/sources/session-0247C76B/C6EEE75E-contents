##### [***Introduction***]{.underline}

The aim of this project is to explore how tools used in the digital humanities help to produce, interpret, and share the history of St Helena Island (Noogoon), Queensland, in the period 1867-1932. I intend to do this by creating a dataset from sources in multiple repositories and thematically analysing them. I will also analyse historic images, and display some of the areas of interest in a map created in QGis.

##### [***Background***]{.underline}

Known as *Noogoon* to the local Indigenous people, the island has its current name thanks to Eulope, the \'...best-known \'fighting headman\' of the Stradbroke Islanders (Quandamooka)\' (Kerkhove 1 January 2018). It was said that he so closely resembled Napoleon Bonaparte that soldiers gave him the nickname \'*Napoleon*\'. Eulope was exiled to Noogoon by Captain Logan in 1827, and the island was regularly referred to as St Helena, alluding to the island in the South Atlantic Ocean where the real Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled only years earlier.

Skip forward to 1865, and St Helena was the location chosen to construct a quarantine station, due to its isolation. Labour for construction was free as prisoners from the hulk \'*Proserpine*\' were made good use of. It was decided in 1867 to convert the buildings into a prison, as Brisbane could no longer house all its prisoners.

Between 1867 and 1869, St Helena was under military guard by the \'*50th (Queen's Own) Regiment*\' (Hopkins-Weise and Pratt 2002), pre-dating warders. St Helena was proclaimed a Penal Establishment in 1867, a \'...high-security \'gaol, prison, and house of correction\' for long-term inmates\' (Boggo Road Gaol Historical Society n.d.) in 1875, and then a Penal Establishment again in 1879. It remained a Penal Establishment until it was decided in the 1920s to turn it into a prison farm until 1932 when the last prisoners left the island (Department of Environment and Science 2005).

[***Harvesting Data from the Web***]{.underline}

To begin this task, I scoured Google and other repositories to see what information was already available. I noticed that while there were a lot of tourist blogs and websites offering tours and giving brief details of the island, there was less written about the \'unexciting\' aspects of the island. While the stories of punishments handed out, a tour of the superintendent\'s house (come museum), and a walk through the ruins are a way of telling the story of the island and its inmates, there was more to tell.

The story of the prisoner\'s cemetery gained my interest. There was little I could find, other than the cookie-cutter explanation that all the graves bear only a marker with a prisoner number as even death didn\'t free them from the prison.

I wanted to know more and found a dataset online regarding the prisoner cemetery, on a cemetery repository site. The dataset was very simple, with not a lot of information beyond the name, prisoner number, and age of the inmates said to be buried in the prisoner plots. I used coding and rstudio to scrape the original dataset from the internet, and keeping the original dataset untouched, I began a dataset adapted from the original.

Using an Excel spreadsheet, I recorded the variables I thought appropriate. In deciding on these, I took into consideration what I thought people would want to know if searching for information about the prisoner cemetery or the prisoners themselves. I searched the internet, available Government repositories, death records, archives, and Ancestry.com. While the latter site is hidden away behind a paywall, I have a subscription.

I used the variables from the original dataset that I thought were important and then added my own variables and data. I was able to add four new prisoners to the list or fill in the blanks that were missing on some prisoners\' details. To make my dataset information transparent, reproducible by anyone, and of interest to researchers, I added variables that included source details to information, such as:

-   Inquest and burial

-   Digital archive files

-   Digital archive series

-   Qld Birth, deaths, and divorces

\

The other variables I thought important were:

-   Where the prisoner was tried

-   Their crime

-   The sentence received

-   Ethnicity

There were three types of sentences, so I gave them a column each, life, years, and months. I made sure I left no cells empty, containing no data, so empty text cells were filled with not applicable (na) and empty numerical cells were filled with a zero (0).

The original dataset was messy, so to tidy it up (the copy I had converged with my new one, the original kept untouched) I used Openrefine. To ensure my dataset would be read easily by any computer, I had to normalise the data, starting with the most obvious fix, removing an empty column and row, which served no purpose other than to add white space, which is undesirable. I then renamed the columns in the merged section, as they ran from X1 through to X8, and the variables were recorded in row 1, so removed them from there and pasted them in the corresponding column headers. I renamed the first column, removing the pound (\#) sign and replacing it with the word number, and placed an underscore (\_), between each word in the column header, to reduce white space and avoid confusion and mistakes resulting from formatting differences between programs. I needed to split the given name column to form a first and separate middle name column. I split the surname column to create an alternate spelling column. I split the alias name column into three, first, second, and surname. I separated the death dates into the year, month, and the date and used text for the months so were clear to people who may view from America, for example, where their date and month are numerically read back to front to Australia so they may read Fourth of December 1878 (4/12/1878) as Twelfth of April 1878 (4/12/1878).

Once I had those looking much tidier, I began checking columns using facets to find any problems with data. I removed leading and trailing white space, in columns that had this, and changed the death date and year column to numerical rather than text so that they would show as numbers during analysis. I also used facets to check spelling, and for any duplicate prisoner numbers or names. I also used openrefine to fill the blank cells with na, as it can do multiple cells at one time.
