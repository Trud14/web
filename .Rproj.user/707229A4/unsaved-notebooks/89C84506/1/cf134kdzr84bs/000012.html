Helena and removing the prisoners to a mainland prison had been raised.","it should be closed and a suitable prison erected in a district where good agricultural land was available.","The island was not the best place for a prison because it was a most costly place to administer.","Many yachtsmen and men of the more or less leisured class - if therc be such a class outside the Tired Tim and mooch-about fraternity— would, metaphorically speaking, move heaven and earth to have the prisoners shifted from St. Helena and to turn that admittedly beautiful spot into sort of Coney Island pleasure ground.","the proximity of the island to Brisbane as an important and (to them) a con-vincing argument in its favor.","Despite its relative success, St Helena was considered by some officials to be unsuitable for the appropriate classification of prisoners.","Following the decision in 1921 to use both divisions of Boggo Road for male prisoners, St Helena became a prison farm after long-term inmates prisoners were transferred to the metropolitan prison. St Helena eventually closed in December 1932.","closed in 1932 when, during the great Depression, it simply became unviable to keep it open. Production had dropped away during World War I when prisoners had to return to the mainland to cover for young men shipped off to the European battlefields. In addition, Boggo Road, which had been used as HM Prison for Women, had also been taking male prisoners since 1903.","proclaimed in May 1867 and was a high security prison for long-term inmates until the 1920s, when it was decided to wind down the prison. It then functioned as a prison farm until it closed in December 1932.","Families were removed from the island in the 1890s, causing dissatisfied warders to live apart from them for up to six weeks at a time. The age of the buildings made them a fire hazard, while their 19 th century design did not accommodate new ideas for prisoner reform.","From the 1920s, St Helena became a prison farm. Long-term prisoners were transferred to Boggo Road Gaol while the remaining prisoners dismantled the prison buildings. The prison was finally closed in December 1932.","once an example of a most successful prison institution, by 1920, problems were arising. The prison was ageing. There was the danger of fire. The buildings were of 19th-century design and did not accommodate new ideas in prison reform. Families of the warders had been moved to the mainland by 1890, which caused dissatisfaction amongst the staff.","The hardened prisoners were moved to Boggo Road Gaol, built in 1889. By 1920 St Helena was a prison farm. The few remaining prisoners slowly dismantled the ageing buildings. Suitable building materials were taken over to the mainland for recycling. Only a few of the original buildings remain. The cattle were auctioned off on the 22nd of May 1931. The last prisoner left the island on the 15th of June 1933.","after the penal establishment closed, this swimming enclosure was central to thwarted development plans seeking to create a health resort or tourist destination in Moreton Bay","Following Macdonald’s departure in 1882, his successor, Capt. Townley, reduced the acreage on the island to provide only for the prison’s needs. This crop was subsequently reduced even further, until in 1890 the prison commenced purchasing sugar from external sources. The sugar mill was converted into a laundry and a herd of dairy cattle was introduced to provide milk, butter and cheese for the prison.","Townley enforced a more rigid discipline than McDonald and the harsh conditions on the island soon earned St Helena the nicknames of the ‘hell-hole of the Paci&lt;U+FFFD&gt;c’ and ‘Queensland’s Inferno’, although the press described it as a model prison.","By the early twentieth century conditions had changed once more under the superintendence of James Ryan and visitors to the island extolled its virtues at length. It was described as the ‘pearl of Moreton Bay’ and ‘the garden of beauty’. Such descriptions aroused public interest and in 1912 a campaign was mounted by the Moreton Bay League for the closure of the prison and the conversion of the island into a place of public recreation. The Government quashed this movement by announcing plans for a new, more substantial prison on St Helena, but this did not proceed and in 1921 it was decided to close the prison and make the island a prison farm. Most of the inmates were removed to Boggo Road Gaol and those who remained were occupied with the demolition of most of the gaol’s infrastructure, including fences, stockade walls, workshops and other buildings.","In 1933 the farm was closed down and the remaining prisoners were transferred to Boggo Road Gaol.","Difficulties in managing an island prison, deterioration of structures and changing attitudes to penology led to the downgrading of The penal establishment to a prison farm in 1921 and to eventual closure in 1933 when the remaining prisoners were relocated to Boggo Road Gaol in South Brisbane.","Administrative problems, the new social conscience, prison reform, the potential for a major fire in the aging timber buildings and the lonely isolation of warders from friends and family led to the prison’s closure in 1932. It had operated very successfully for 65 years.","Historical significance was not recognised and so, in 1925, demolition of the buildings began. This work was also done by prisoners and most re-usable materials were taken to the mainland for distribution to other Government institutions.","The First World War put a temporary halt to many public projects across the country, including prison reform. In 1921, however, the prison on the island of St Helena, off the coast of southern Queensland was converted to a prison farm.49 Officials at the time saw change on the island as part of the wave of reform from the south. There had been a large prison on the island since the 1860s, and as part of the conversion, the inmates were put to work dismantling the old cellblock buildings.","prison farm did not last long: it was closed in 1933, following significant public pressure for its removal, so that the island might be re-made into a beauty spot for boaters and picnickers.","In 1924, after a prisoner with a record of violence escaped from St Helena, the Brisbane Sun railed against the Queensland prisons service: ‘This slipshod imitation of a gaol has now been in existence too long, and it is time that it was tightened up … If this thing is to be called a gaol, then let it be something approaching one at least’.9 This was one of a number of sensational escapes in the mid-1920s which fuelled sentiment against the St Helena institution, contributing to its closure in 1933","Except in the cost of transferring the prisoners to a main land gaol, we cannot see any valid reason for continuing to use the island for its present purpose.","as the Home Secretary himself admits, there is greater cost in the maintenance of an island prison because of the cost of transport and loss of time for officials and other travelling-to and from the place, — to say nothing of inconvenience to mar— ried members of the prison staff.","It is understood that the Cotnptrollcr— General of Prisons (Major A. T. Peirson) is in favour of transferring the prison to the mainland.","On the point of expense, Mr. Huxham points out that at present most of the buildings on the island are in a dilapidated and dangerous condition and the cost of a new island prison would be about £120,000 as against only half that sum for the construction of a mainland prison.","The prison closed in 1932 when, during the great Depression, it simply became unviable to keep it open.","Production had dropped away during World War I when prisoners had to return to the mainland to cover for young men shipped off to the European battle","from the 1920s, as men were returned to the metropolis from the deteriorating facility on St Helena and had to be accommodated","hoeing, digging potatoes, wood cutting, etc.","so cleverly do the prison authorities arrange matters that St. Helena is practically self-support-ing.","It is the penal establishment proper of the colony of Queensland. Over 120 prisoners are at work there, growing sugar cane and making sugar, quarrying, building jetties and works for the purposes of a prison, growing grasses of various kinds, and sweet potatoes and other crops, and mutton for the use of the establishment.","There are about 100 acres of arable land, of vol-canic origin, and very fair quality. This is all under cultivation. In all, in little bits of flats, above high water level, around the lower portion of the island may be about 100 acres of grass land; and there may be as much, or more, swamp and boggy flats, covered at high water, and of no particular value until levees and draining wheels are erected-all of which are in the future.

It grows from seeds and roots, but requires cultivation, and is well worth cultivating in the coast districts.","The system followed is reclamatory and instructive rather than compulsory.","Men learn to labor and be useful there, and we have often, and in various parts of the country, met those seen in the first instance at St. Helena who are making the effort, and successfully, to respect the laws, and to labor in honesty for their living.-In this country it is a privilege that no man who has the will and health is too far gone to adopt.","value of work performed by prisoners was £18,860 of which St. Helena was credited with £12,447.

The original vegetation of the island was mainly subtropical rainforest.","midden shells which previously overlaid the beachrock were probably burnt in the prison lime kiln. Observation in eroded patches and auger ing have established that the midden extends about 500 m along the beach ridge on which it is located, but it ha&amp; been increasingly disturbed and scattered by roadworks, tramway bedding and ploughing north from the intersection of the beach ridge and the line of the former tramway (Fig. 2).","landscape reveals a small bridge from St Helena’s famous long jetty to the jail which no one knew existed.

Production had dropped away during World War I when prisoners had to return to the mainland to cover for young men shipped off to the European battlefields. In addition, Boggo Road, which had been used as HM Prison for Women, had also been taking male prisoners since 1903.","The prison era St Helena Penal Establishment was considered a model prison of its time. The superintendent and warders managed a highly disciplined prison, where security was tight and successful escapes were few.","Distance and isolation enforced basic self-sufficiency. While this came about through necessity, it also resulted in economic profit.","The early years saw prisoners clearing native vegetation, planting crops and constructing buildings. The island’s resources were used wherever possible - buildings were constructed from sandstone blocks quarried from the southern flats and bricks moulded from island clay mixes. A lime kiln was constructed to burn coral for cement. Maize and vegetable crops, supplemented with sheep and cattle herds, provided much of the island residents’ food requirements. The most successful island produce included sugar cane and award-winning Ayrshire dairy cattle. Olive oil produced from the island’s olive groves also won prizes in Italy.","By 1900 the St Helena Establishment accommodated 330 prisoners and operated as a self-sufficient unit. The prisoners were taught carpentry, boot making, tailoring, tinsmithing, bread making, and butchery. Vegetables thrived in the rich soil. The sugar mill crushed locally grown sugar. The most successful outcomes were the sugar cane, the growing of olives, and the prize-winning Ayrshire dairy herd, introduced in 1892.","It is the earliest attempt in Queensland at providing prison facilities which were essentially self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient and aimed at providing inmates with the opportunity for self-improvement and rehabilitation.","philosophy of prisoner rehabilitation was changing from the earlier ethos of punishment and isolation. The aim was to provide prisoners with a full day of constructive activity and instruction which would equip them with life skills. In addition, the &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nancial strictures of the colony made it desirable for the prison to be as self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient as possible. McDonald showed considerable initiative and perseverance in meeting these demands.","A further area was devoted to growing maize, sugar cane and vegetables for the prison. Fifty acres were cleared with the intention of planting sugar cane. This was to be processed in a sugar re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;nery on site.","One of the most successful early enterprises undertaken on the island was the growing and processing of sugar. McDonald trained himself in the processes involved and the mill was considered something of a wonder in its own right. The crushing rollers were horse-driven and hand fed by the prisoners. The syrup was gravity fed into vats for boiling down and crystallisation. The &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nal product was a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ne golden coloured sugar of table quality which was used, not only by other government institutions, but was sold commercially. Both cane and sugar won many awards at the annual International Exhibition. The cane served other useful functions on the island, the trash providing fuel for the warders’ &lt;U+FFFD&gt;res.","Following Macdonald’s departure in 1882, his successor, Capt. Townley, reduced the acreage on the island to provide only for the prison’s needs. This crop was subsequently reduced even further, until in 1890 the prison commenced purchasing sugar from external sources. The sugar mill was converted into a laundry and a herd of dairy cattle was introduced to provide milk, butter and cheese for the prison.","“At &lt;U+FFFD&gt;rst, prisoners were set to work growing sugar cane, however the cane provided too many hiding places so it was replaced by lucerne and potatoes.”","limited area of St Helena Island and the increasing needs of the settlement resulted in the conversion of the natural environment into a manicured landscape of gardens, agricultural plots and grassed paddocks.","overcrowding in Brisbanes gaols resulted in the conversion of the buildings, originally intended for a quarantine station, into accommodation for prisoners. Prison labour was used for all activities on the island, from the construction of buildings and roadways to growing, processing and cooking of food.","The Superintendent and the warders ran the prison in a highly efficient manner. For most of the prison’s 65 years; self-sufficiency was a necessity and profit was the product of that efficiency.","All the land suitable for cultivation, some seventy acres, is now under sugar cane. A portion - perhaps a third - of this land is good;","The island has been stripped of timber; a few trees only of the dense growth that formerly covered it are now standing. They are close to the garden of the Superintendent. A few mangrove bushes still occupy a portion of the low wet land with which the island is surrounded. The high and dry land is covered with cane; and some seven or eight acres of mulberry trees have been planted on steep banks. This total clearing of the island was adopted that there might be no cover for prisoners who attempted to escape.","warders can now see clear over the whole place. But this free exposure is bad for the cane. The winds come in unbroken gusts upon it, and have during the past winter converted fully one-half of the entire crop into a tangled mass of damaged and broken cane. All the varieties - Bourbon, Diard, Chigacca, Salan-gore, and Guigham - have suffered from the winds. The ribbon cane alone has withstood the storms, and promises a fair return in sugar.","cutting, carting, &amp;c., is also done by prisoners, and with so little apparent supervision that the men differed in no respect from ordinary field hands.","self-funded penal settlement, had a commercial grove of olive trees in the early 1900’s.","there is a Helena Olive Tree variety","The original Helena Olive was planted in the late 1800�s on St Helena Island","The original olive made its way from Europe to the Island, via a magistrate, and has continued to thrive in the testing Moreton Bay environment.","The Helena Olive will fruit in the South East Queensland climate, which for an olive is impressive in itself.","originally grown on St HelenaIsland in MoretonBay for over the past 100 years, it has truly proved itself to be an outstanding performer for our climate.

The dire condition of colonial finances, combined with concerns for maintaining discipline, settled the future of the penal system for the next fifty years. The government hoped that St Helena could become self-sustaining and perhaps profitable. A range of trades and workshops would be introduced, and for this able-bodied men, preferably with skills, were required. By the time of the report on St Helena (1869), the government’s view was that St Helena should become the premier penal establishment for men.

In the first room is a babel at conflicting sounds. There is the banging of hammers, the zir-r-r of flying machinery, and the click of tools. On the left are bootmakers, and on the right saddlers, brushmakers, and bookbinders.","Rows of quiet men, in the regulation prison suits stamped with the broad arrow, and numbered one, two, three, or four as the case may be, are busily engaged in sewing and cutting leather, controlling machines, &amp;c.

Beyond the shallows are deep channels-flats and shallows are lively with sharks, the outside “guards” of the place","In one of these channels, on the south-east side of the island, a buoy is fastened, and a barge, a rickety-looking concern, is anchored-it looks all ready to sink. From hence the landing is made. Boats sent off from the island and the boats of the steamer take the passengers into shallow water, where they are met by spring-carts and drays, and taken ashore. A jetty is being built of conglomerate stone, found on the island, which will simplify the landing process. This jetty is a heavy work, owing to the great length it has to be carried out (some 1800 feet), ere deep water is reached.","we reach ” the stockade,” after a march of about a quarter of a mile from the landing. The stockade is fenced with sawn hardwood, some 15 feet high, and after certain preliminaries are attended to, the party are admitted into a gravelled yard.

These consist of rooms, divided by partitions of hardwood, but open through strong gratings of hardwood on the face next the main corridor or passage of the prison; and cells, each for a man, who is completely shut off from his fellows.","Lights are maintained all night in the corridors, and warders are on duty all the time, pacing their walks and rounds inside and outside the prison.","passages are laid with heavy matting. The warders wear slippers; their movements can be seen, not heard.","he storekeeper, Mr. North, conducts a school, at which some 15 little ones attend. They were all very young, and well up in the rudiments of a plain education.","The practice is to hoist a signal flag on the Government steamer when there is a clergyman on board desirous of holding service. The men are mustered at once, and such as desire to attend do so. The others return to their work.","The visiting justice comes down with every steamer, and the sheriff occasionally. Serious cases, and what may be considered the official business of the prison, are brought before these gentlemen.

With few exceptions, they are in a sorry plight. Years of use, in rough hands generally, have shaken them badly. The works are mostly of travels, and of the order instructive, with a few of the mildest kind of novels. There is quite a demand for this literature, and an extension of the collection seems amongst the things desirable for St. Helena.","At various times men of considerable attainments have been inmates of the island. St. Helena was surveyed and mapped by one who had been an engineer officer on the staff of General Lee during the American war: and the offices of the justices, the superintendent, and others are decorated with maps, plans, and sketches of the island that bear testimony to the skill of the designers.","But news spreads somehow amongst these unfortunates. The late comers tell of what is going on in the outside world.","Amongst the more intelligent men to whom “indulgences” are granted, a desire has arisen for information regarding the methods of carrying on war, military engineering, &amp;c., and the excellent private library of the superintendent has been taxed in order to supply works that are not in the prison library, but which come within the range of literature allowed to prisoners.","twelve years the prison has existed, and many of these men have been in a miserable plight on arrival, the mortality has been small.","there are also the graves of twelve men who had been prisoners upon the island. The graves are nicely kept;","graves of the prisoners are also fenced, and a neat slab of timber bears the name, age, and number of each of those beneath.

But they rest in peace there, on that beautiful grassy slope just above high-water mark, facing the east on St. Helena.","The garden of the superintendent is one of the finest in Queensland. It is not large, but the collection of useful and ornamental trees is rich and varied; and the place is kept in splendid order. The cocoanut and English oak, and scores of trees of less extreme qualities flourish there. Mr. M’Donald and his good lady have a keen sense for plants of every kind that have usefulness or beauty to recommend them.","Indulgence allowance is only granted after the probationary period is over, and this probationary period depends on previous convictions.

He then proceeded to name the others in the group Green Island 2 and Green Island 3 (King Island). Green Island 2 was renamed St Helena in 1827. And that is a story in itself.","In 1866, a quarantine station was built on St Helena, but within a year, it was realised it would be much better use solving the problem of what to do with all the prisoners.","At the tip of the original causeway is a “swimming pool”. Prisoners placed steel tram tracks vertically into the water to make an enclosure for wardens to swim safely away from sharks.","Queensland’s first tram was drawn from the stockade to the causeway, initially by convicts.

Prisoners from the hulk Proserpine, moored at the mouth of the Brisbane River, were rowed daily to work at the site, and two buildings were completed. Due to the massive overcrowding of the Brisbane Goal in Petrie Terrace at that time, new buildings on St Helena were modified for use as a goal.","More buildings were constructed on the island, made of timber, others of the soft beach stone, quarried from the southern flats of the island.

(129) In this transmission from Police, Water Police, to Gaoler of the prison hulk Proserpine, McDonald became intimately associated with the establishment of the Penal Establishment on St Helena Island during 1866-67. In assessing the initial stages of building and works on the island, the Colonial Architect relayed in early 1867: Some eighteen prisoners had been employed on the Island of St Helena from February 1866, first in the erection of a Lockup, and latterly in the construction of the two buildings, under the supervision of a Foreman of Carpenters, assisted by one freeman for the better joiner’s work, the prisoners passing backwards and forward to the Hulk `Proserpine’ anchored off Fisherman’s Island, some four or five miles distant, until within the last two months [November 1866], when the Hulk was removed to an anchorage nearer the Island in order to allow the full compliment of prisoners to be put to work at the new Convict depot, in finishing the buildings above mentioned, clearing the scrub, and completing a jetty near the Lockup.","first Superintendent of the Penal Establishment at St Helena on 14 May 1867.

With the `project of making St Helena a Quarantine Station being abandoned’ these buildings were converted `into convict buildings’ so as `to meet the demand for extra prison accommodation’ when it was decided to instead use the St Helena for that purpose. (134) This report also included details on the proposed accommodation on the eastern side of the island of the Military Guard who were shortly expected to commence duties: The prisoners are now engaged on these works and one of the buildings, that on the West Side of the bluff, will be ready for the reception of about 60 prisoners in the course of a week … but as it is the intention of the Government to put a military guard over the prisoners on St Helena, and no shelter being as yet available, the prison wards cannot be used until the building on the East bank has been temporarily fitted up for the reception of the guard, and this cannot be finished for some three or four weeks to come, as the roof is not yet on the building, and the work being done by prisoners, a longer time is required than if it were being done by free men.

Noting the mangrove forests and mud&lt;U+FB02&gt;ats that surrounded Noogoon on his survey chart, Finders observed the island’s height and ‘dark and luxuriant’ foliage relative to other nearby islands.","British colonial impetus to settle in Moreton Bay came from Royal Commis— sioner John Bigge (1819–22), who argued that additional isolated penal settlements were required on the tropical coastline of what is now Queensland to hold and deter secondary convict offenders.","A boom of migration from Europe into Queensland and increasing incursion of settlers into Aboriginal lands during the late nineteenth century saw a rise in frontier con&lt;U+FB02&gt;icts and arrests, which meant that Petrie Terrace gaol was soon full and the British practice of locking prisoners into unseaworthy ships was required.","From the mid-1850s, St Helena Island was a base for dugong processing, with the netting process attracting sharks: ‘During the boiling session, numbers of sharks lurked about the nets, and while feeding upon the entrapped Dugong, frequently became entangled in the nets themselves.’39","St Helena Island was used for quarantining arrivals from 1862 and by 1865 plans were made to build some timber structures on the island.","Surveyor H.C.

The &lt;U+FB01&gt;rst few years were dedicated to building two cell blocks, a kitchen, bakehouse, hospital, underground water tanks, boathouse, storehouse, jetty and Superintendents home and stables (Figure 3). Beach rock was mined and used to construct buildings and the western causeway, which served as the point of entry to the island.","Seaside destinations and sea bathing were linked to tourism and ideas about health and wellbeing with the growing settlement of Redcliffe advertised as a ‘sanatorium for the sick’.53 Shark-proof swimming enclosures (kiosks and dressing rooms) were an architectural feature of many popular Queensland beaches from the 1880s and 1890s.","St Helena, by the 1900s the penal establishment held over 300 prisoners. Those with privileges were permitted to swim in the sea once week ‘at their own risk’.57 Guards supervised their activities day and night to ensure no one escaped.

They began sinking wells, clearing scrubs, quarrying stone and building accommodation for a new quarantine station. Plans for a quarantine station were eventually replaced by the more urgent need for a new prison. On May 14, 1867 the island was declared a penal prison.","During the 1840s and ’50s the island was a base for the hunting and processing of dugong for meat and oil, which was valued for medicinal purposes.","In 1865 when a quarantine station was planned, the vegetation of the island was divided between mangrove swamp, scrub land and grass &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ats. Its isolation made it ideal as a location for a quarantine station. Buildings were designed by Charles Tif&lt;U+FFFD&gt;n, Colonial Architect, and construction work commenced in 1865 using labour from the prison hulk ‘Proserpine’, moored at the mouth of the Brisbane River.","Work proceeded slowly and by 1867 overcrowding in Brisbane prisons had increased to such an extent that it was decided to convert the proposed quarantine station into a prison and to retain the existing quarantine facilities at Dunwich.","In 1868 a substantial timber barracks to house approximately 130 prisoners was completed, in addition to the buildings and jetty previously constructed for the quarantine station.","A tramline had been constructed between the prison compound and the jetty in the late 1870s to move goods and raw materials. A series of temporary lines were also laid down and relocated as required to transport everything from laundry to the nightsoil brought from the mainland and buried in trenches on the island in the 1880s. A variety of rolling stock was used over the years including a two-handed pumper vehicle similar to that used on railways. This was eventually superseded by a horse drawn tram car which operated for some thirty years. In the 1930s the tramway fell into disrepair and the rails were removed, although much of the associated earthworks remain.","In 1867, prisoners stationed on the hulk Proserpine were building the St Helena Stockade which was to be Brisbane’s new gaol.

A gang of men were working in the quarry at the western end of the island, behind the superintendent’s house. War-der Rhodes, in charge, was on the ground. A number of men were on top engaged in cutting out shelves. It was midwinter; rain and mist obscured the atmosphere, and a semi-darkness set in about 4 o’clock in the afternoon. Two young fellows, each serving a three-years term, slipped away from the top unseen by the warder, and hiding in the mangrove swamp, were not missed until, about ten minutes to 5, when the gang mustered for return to the stockade.","younger of the two gaol-breakers was found in the mud, wet and hungry, about 7 o’clock, and created a good deal of amusement, on being returned to the stockade, by demanding, “Where’s MY HOMINY?” The other, a more experienced bushman, was at large until nearly midnight. He got into the water, and remained concealed there, his head hidden by the overhanging branches of a mangrove tree, until he thought he mightly safely venture forth. His plan was to get one of the horses, and by its aid swim the shark-infested channel to the mainland. The plan miscarried, owing to all the horses having been stabled, as soon as the alarm was given. As he approached the stable-door, he found himself look-, ing down the barrel of a rifle steadily poised in the hands of a warder.","At noon, on Saturday, the Visit-ing Justice, Mr. T. H. Barron, Inspector Lewis, and a body of police, with a black tracker, pro-ceeded to St. Helena Penal Establishment to assist in searching for two prisoners who had escaped from the working gangs engaged cutting down the man-grove scrub. On their arrival they found that the Water Police and Customs boats had been guarding the island all night, and had made diligent search during the morning.","They had tracked the two runaways to the beach and back, and also found a rudely constructed raft, made of bits of small drift wood, about a quarter of a mile from the beach, to seaward, which led the searchers to believe that the prisoners had either been attacked by sharks or drowned, as the raft was only sufficient to hold on to by the hands, the body bung immersed.","Had they succeeded in getting away from the island, there is little doubt that they must have been drowned, as the wind and tide would have taken them out to sea by the north passage.","The prisoners are both young men, the eldest being William Read, who was convicted of horse-stealing at Roma on the 21st April last, and sentenced to seven years’ penal servitude. The other, named James English, was convicted at the same place for a less offence in July, 1867, and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.","suicide of a trade instructor. There was, it transpires, some connection between the escape and the tragedy in so far as the whisky which the convict Craig had in his possession in the gaol hospital, and gave to two of the inmates who slept while the escape was being executed, was innocently supplied in a spirit of mistaken kindness, by the unfortunate man who afterwards took his own life.","the convicts have been tried in accordance with the prison regulations, for breaking gaol, but no information as to the punish-ment meted out has so far been allowed to transpire.","convict Hamilton, who disappeared from St Helena Island Prison last Thurs-day evening, was recaptured at about 11 o’clock yesterday morning.","A warder, on duty, had his attention attracted by an object floating in the sea several hun-dred yards distant from the shore of the island, in the direction of the boat pas-sage. He immediately reported the mat-ter to his chief, and the prison launch, manned by a number of warders, put out to sea and was soon heading towards the floating object.","As the launch drew closer it was no-ticed that the object was almost sub-merged. On it was the body of a man which was almost under the water. When the launch drew alongside the man was discovered to be Hamilton, the escaped convict. He was still dressed in prison garb and he was secured by the warders and placed on board the launch without any resistance. In fact, he was in too weak a condition, from the exposure and want of food, to resist. The object he was floating on was taken in tow and the party returned to the island, where the floating object was discovered to consist of two long forms, lashed together.","Friday morning last, three prisoners named Irwin, Dawson, and Morris","A party of soldiers and warders started in pursuit of the runa-ways, who managed to secrete themselves in a thick scrub. Their pursuers, however, placed themselves in such a manner as to be able to discover any attempt on their part to leave their lurking place to procure food; they were, consequently, captured without re-sistance early on Saturday morning.","In their posses-sion was found two washing g tubs and a washing board, imperfectly fastened together with rope","The Police Magistrate, Mr. Massie, and the Water Police Magistrate, Mr. Thorn— ton, held an investigation on Monday last concerning the escape of the prisoners, and sentenced them to be flogged.

The alarm was given and all the warders and police gave chase, within 20 minutes 5 of the runaways were apprehended, the sixth, was apprehended by myself at 8 pm. They were all safely locked up in single cells in the new prison. The prisoners names were: James McPherson, 25 years Patrick Gary 15 years Henry Ross 15 years James Howard 10 years John Dyball 7 years. Henry Ross was slightly wounded on the right hand with a rifle shot.","The early prison years were the toughest, with severe punishments involving the lash and the dreaded dark underground cells. Very few prisoners escaped; only three disappeared without a trace. Two were drowned or taken by sharks.","fear of sharks was also used as leverage against people detained on St Helena Island in Moreton Bay.","Escape from the island was partly deterred by the expanse of surrounding waters and the perceived fear that human-eating sharks inhabited these waters.","Two prisoners managed to escape in the process of construction","The idea that escapees from the island who were able to avoid drowning and swim the signi&lt;U+FB01&gt;cant distances to land would eventually have to take their chances against circling sharks was perpetrated by of&lt;U+FB01&gt;cials and linked to the rare reporting of fatal shark attacks appearing in the media.","St Helena, by the 1900s the penal establishment held over 300 prisoners. Those with privileges were permitted to swim in the sea once week ‘at their own risk’.57 Guards supervised their activities day and night to ensure no one escaped. Stories circulated that sharks were fed deliberately to encourage their presence around the island to prevent escapes.","fear of shark attacks was promoted by authorities and the press from the earliest days of the maximum-security penal establishment. For example, an early escape attempt was accompanied by the report that ‘the men had gone into the water about two feet when they found the sharks so numerous that they had to refrain’ and an 1869 report stated: A very ef&lt;U+FB01&gt;cient police around the island, in the shape of sharks, which render it next to impossible for anyone to escape the island to the mainland by swimming.","Several prisoners have attempted to escape that way but, when they saw the immense number of sharks that were swimming about, they were glad to return, with haste, to the island.","Finger also found this idea still being promoted in 1914, with a report stating that ‘If the escapee had only thought of the sharks, he would not have made the attempt to escape, and the marvel is that he was not eaten.’59","Escapes were few, with some reports highlighting the threat of sharks: ‘One of the escaping inmates was reportedly taken by sharks, an Aboriginal man known to his community on Mornington Island as Kitikir, but to the Queensland press as “Burketown Peter”’.60 Transported down to St Helena and imprisoned for the murder of a missionary, the press surrounding Kitikir’s escape was sensational, &lt;U+FB01&gt;rst reporting his swimming escape: Still at Large. The whereabouts of the [A]boriginal Burketown Peter, who disappeared from the St Helena Prison on Sunday, has not yet been discovered : : : It is not improbable that the blackfellow, accustomed to the Gulf country and familiar with phases of life, is an accomplished swimmer, and that he has attempted to reach either Mud or Green Island, though the result of the police search would seem to disfavor this theory. These waters are reputed to be infested with sharks, but the blacks of the Far North are not unfamiliar with the task of &lt;U+FB01&gt;ghting such an enemy, from which they are also less liable to attack than white men.61 Newspaper reports at the time suggested his death was from drowning and shark attack: 130 Queensland Review Sharing the waterways Burketown Peter, a full-blooded [A]boriginal, escaped from his cell in January 1921, and put to sea in a raft of planks. He was seen and pursued. Diving from the raft, he did not return to the surface and was probably taken by sharks.62 However, his cause of death remains uncertain, with later reports suggest that Kitikir had been shot while escaping, with the ‘son of a former warder on the island, cryptically, perhaps knowingly, stating: “I think he might have been despatched by other means”.’63","the alarm raised at St. Helena on Tuesday was caused by two aboriginal convicts rushing from the gang in which they were working, and concealing themselves in a clump of cane. They would not answer to the repeated calls of the warders, so that the “alarm” was given and a search for the fugi— tives commenced. The gangs at work in the fields and in the boiling-house were marched to their quarters, and the whole force at the disposal of the Superintendent, Mr. McDonald, was directed to the capture of the runaways, Watcbes were also set to prevent them escap— ing from the island.","The men are named Sandy and Johnny respectively, the former undergoing a life sentence for a criminal assault on a woman on the Gympie road to Maryborough, and the latter a sentence of seven years’ penal servitude for abetting in the crime.

It is not unlikely they have succeeded in their design, unless the sharks have interfered to prevent it being carried to a successful issue.","“It is seldom,” says the Brisbane Courier, “that a prisoner after effecting his escape from a penal establishment, and enjoying several years of freedom, is found to yield himself up to the authorities with the intention of performing the portion of his sentence which remained unexpired at the time of his escape, but a case of the kind has occurred here within the last few days.","4th August, 1866, a man named Charles Court, who was undergoing a sentence of five years’ penal servitude at St. Helena, for horse-stealing, contrived to escape in a boat with a fellow-prisoner, and get clear away. Court made his way to New South Wales, and from all accounts he appears to have behaved well during the last five years","he travelled overland to Warwick, and surrendered himself to the police there. He has four years and one month of his sentence to serve.”","The chief disadvantage of the cane crop was the cover it provided for malingerers or absconding prisoners.","The shark-infested waters of Moreton Bay were a barrier to escape, although this was achieved on a few occasions.","prisoner, Frank Gale, had complained on the 18 attempted escape – 20 Jan January 1932 that timber he had selected for his work detail had disappeared.

Both prisoners pleaded guilty to the &lt;U+FFFD&gt;rst charge, Runkel receiving a sentence of four days of half rations. Phillips was given a more severe punishment, being sentenced to one month hard labour to be added onto the end of his current sentence. As to the second charge both pleaded innocent. Yet the Visiting Justice deemed that both men were guilty, adding a further extension to their sentences of one month of hard labour.","during the prison’s 65 year history only three escape attempts had ever succeeded.","One of the greatest escape attempts lasted 11 days and was carried out by two prisoners: Henry Craig and David McIntyre.","In November 1911, Craig and McIntyre planned their escape. Coordinating to be in the hospital on the same night, McIntyre had secured the tools required for the escape from the tailor shop.","Craig had been gifted three-quarters of a cup (six ounces) of whisky from Warder","the whisky being distributed to other inmates in the hospital. Using the tools from the tailor shop, Craig and McIntyre chiselled out the door jamb during the night. They started their escape at 4am. By leaving the door intact, the alarm was not raised until 5.25am. On the &lt;U+FFFD&gt;rst day of their escape, Craig and McIntyre moved from the hospital through the lumberyard, before hiding in the tinsmith’s workshop roof. From 6 to 15 November, Craig and McIntyre remained hidden in the cavity. Food was secretly delivered by a fellow inmate.","After nightfall on 16 November, Craig and McIntyre left the roof and acquired tools from the workshops to scale one of the prison gates. Once out, they made their way to the boathouse where they attempted to move two boats. They were unsuccessful. After failing to coerce a horse into dragging the smaller boat to shore, they gave up.","Craig and McIntyre presented themselves back at the stockade on the morning of 17 November. They had managed to avoid authorities for 11 days without leaving the island. A formal inquiry into the escape was held. Warder Rawlinson expressed guilt over the gifting of the whisky. On 28 November 1911, before the inquiry had concluded and at only 34 years of age, Warder Rawlinson committed suicide by cutting his throat.","entries were posted, windows barred and warders were constantly on the alert.","In 1924, after a prisoner with a record of violence escaped from St Helena, the Brisbane Sun railed against the Queensland prisons service: ‘This slipshod imitation of a gaol has now been in existence too long, and it is time that it was tightened up … If this thing is to be called a gaol, then let it be something approaching one at least’.9 This was one of a number of sensational escapes in the mid-1920s which fuelled sentiment against the St Helena institution, contributing to its closure in 1933","One remarkable escapee from St Helena Prison Farm made good in a different country, and later returned to Queensland voluntarily, to serve out the remainder of his sentence. In 1929, John Stelling swam to a dinghy tethered to a buoy, a short distance from the island. After rowing to the mainland, he went to Sydney. He was an engineer by trade, and secured a berth as an engine hand on a steamer heading for London. He later said that after several years living a law-abiding life in England, he became ‘unhappy in the knowledge that I was a fugitive from justice and my varying fortunes convinced me that I would have been wiser to have served out the remaining four months of my sentence’.97 He returned to Australia, and, on 27 September 1934 gave himself up at Boggo Road Gaol. The superintendent recognised him and declared ‘Why, you’re John Stelling … I would have thought that this was the last place for you to visit’. Stelling replied: ‘Yes … I want to get this whole business over with. What do I have to do?’ He was officially released after serving the remaining four months plus an extra two and a half for the theft of the dingy and the destruction of the padlock on his cell door","The island has been stripped of timber; a few trees only of the dense growth that formerly covered it are now standing. They are close to the garden of the Superintendent. A few mangrove bushes still occupy a portion of the low wet land with which the island is surrounded. The high and dry land is covered with cane; and some seven or eight acres of mulberry trees have been planted on steep banks. This total clearing of the island was adopted that there might be no cover for prisoners who attempted to escape.","Preserved in a bottle are the third and fourth fingers of a prisoner’s left hand, which he cut off in a tinsmith’s guillotine, so that he would be sent to the Brisbane General Hospital, and so would have a chance to escape. He did escape, but was caught some months afterwards.","Sugar production wasn’t entirely successful as it was feared escapees could easily hide in the cane","Escapes were rare, any attempt considered “a gratuitous self-in&lt;U+FB02&gt;iction of punishment”. Warders watched every movement from sentry boxes above the four corners of the stockade and even if an escapee did make it out, they had to survive swarms of mosquitoes in the mangroves around the island before tackling the strong currents and shark-infested waters for more than 5km to the mainland.","While a former prisoner wrote in 1886 of a lad convicted for horse-stealing successfully paddling a washing tub to the mainland, history records only one successful escape. Gunman Charles Leslie had accomplices waiting in a motor boat offshore early one morning in 1924.","When the scheme was brought into operation, St. Helena Penal Establish-ment would be mainly used as a farm colony, and well-conducted, long-time prisoners would be sent there for special treatment","hoeing, digging potatoes, wood cutting, etc.","coal-lumping","so cleverly do the prison authorities arrange matters that St. Helena is practically self-support-ing.","I attribute the health of the inmates to their regular hours, to their regular meals, and to the out-door work which those who are not tradesmen, or gaol apologies for tradesmen, are engaged on.","One day I was with a gang working in a quarry. Some of the men were up on a shelf, throwing down material, to be wheeled away in barrows. I was —much against my will — doing the “horse act” between the shafts of a cumbrous and capacious vehicle of the wheelbar-row persuasion.","Joe was on top, shovelling down dirt.

Th, warder insisted. I point-blank refused.","I was taken before the superintendent and. ordered to the cells for three days on half rations. That three days, without a book or a word from anyone was just hell. Once to while away the time I dipped the end of my finger in the dry whitewash of the cell-wall, and on the back of the door (painted, brown) drew a caricature of the warder who had got me the three days.

This lime kiln is older, having been constructed in 1869 by prisoners incarcerated on the island. They needed to create lime to produce mortar for the building of the prison walls that would eventually contain them and their product of choice was the lime rich shells and coral fragments found in the shallow waters and coral reefs surrounding the island.","St Helena’s lime kiln continuously produced large quantities of lime, with 360 bushels in the first year of 1869 and 1302 bags in 1890.

The island’s resources were used wherever possible - buildings were constructed from sandstone blocks quarried from the southern flats and bricks moulded from island clay mixes. A lime kiln was constructed to burn coral for cement. Maize and vegetable crops, supplemented with sheep and cattle herds, provided much of the island residents’ food requirements. The most successful island produce included sugar cane and award-winning Ayrshire dairy cattle. Olive oil produced from the island’s olive groves also won prizes in Italy.","From the 1920s, St Helena became a prison farm. Long-term prisoners were transferred to Boggo Road Gaol while the remaining prisoners dismantled the prison buildings. The prison was finally closed in December 1932.","original dry vine forest was cleared, some natural regrowth and revegetation has occurred.","By 1900 the St Helena Establishment accommodated 330 prisoners and operated as a self-sufficient unit. The prisoners were taught carpentry, boot making, tailoring, tinsmithing, bread making, and butchery. Vegetables thrived in the rich soil. The sugar mill crushed locally grown sugar. The most successful outcomes were the sugar cane, the growing of olives, and the prize-winning Ayrshire dairy herd, introduced in 1892.","The hardened prisoners were moved to Boggo Road Gaol, built in 1889. By 1920 St Helena was a prison farm. The few remaining prisoners slowly dismantled the ageing buildings. Suitable building materials were taken over to the mainland for recycling. Only a few of the original buildings remain. The cattle were auctioned off on the 22nd of May 1931. The last prisoner left the island on the 15th of June 1933.","the alarm raised at St. Helena on Tuesday was caused by two aboriginal convicts rushing from the gang in which they were working, and concealing themselves in a clump of cane. They would not answer to the repeated calls of the warders, so that the “alarm” was given and a search for the fugi— tives commenced. The gangs at work in the fields and in the boiling-house were marched to their quarters, and the whole force at the disposal of the Superintendent, Mr. McDonald, was directed to the capture of the runaways, Watcbes were also set to prevent them escap— ing from the island.","Prisoners were taught trades in the island’s workshops, including tailoring, boot-making, bread baking and butchery. The island’s prize dairy herd won many awards at the Brisbane Ekka.","Potatoes, maize and other vegetables grew very well in the rich volcanic soil. The island’s sugar mill produced about 75 tons of sugar each year.","It is the earliest attempt in Queensland at providing prison facilities which were essentially self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient and aimed at providing inmates with the opportunity for self-improvement and rehabilitation.","philosophy of prisoner rehabilitation was changing from the earlier ethos of punishment and isolation. The aim was to provide prisoners with a full day of constructive activity and instruction which would equip them with life skills. In addition, the &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nancial strictures of the colony made it desirable for the prison to be as self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient as possible. McDonald showed considerable initiative and perseverance in meeting these demands.","Under McDonald’s care the prison was described by newspaper journalists as being of the highest standard with clean, healthy prisoners engaged in constructive enterprises that provided them with excellent opportunities for self improvement. The aim of self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ciency was re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ected in the process by which new prison buildings were constructed when they were needed. Plans were prepared by several long-serving prisoners to the requirements of the Superintendent, the government architect not being employed. The materials were obtained on the island when possible.","The scrub was not suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient to meet the demand for building timber, but the island stone and the lime extracted from neighbouring coral reefs provided raw materials for many of the structures. The lime was burned in a kiln constructed on the island by 1869 using bricks and the local stone. Later, when the sugar mill was operational, the lime produced was used for settling the vegetable matter suspended in the sugar syrup.","A further area was devoted to growing maize, sugar cane and vegetables for the prison. Fifty acres were cleared with the intention of planting sugar cane. This was to be processed in a sugar re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;nery on site.","One of the most successful early enterprises undertaken on the island was the growing and processing of sugar. McDonald trained himself in the processes involved and the mill was considered something of a wonder in its own right. The crushing rollers were horse-driven and hand fed by the prisoners. The syrup was gravity fed into vats for boiling down and crystallisation. The &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nal product was a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ne golden coloured sugar of table quality which was used, not only by other government institutions, but was sold commercially. Both cane and sugar won many awards at the annual International Exhibition. The cane served other useful functions on the island, the trash providing fuel for the warders’ &lt;U+FFFD&gt;res.","Following Macdonald’s departure in 1882, his successor, Capt. Townley, reduced the acreage on the island to provide only for the prison’s needs. This crop was subsequently reduced even further, until in 1890 the prison commenced purchasing sugar from external sources. The sugar mill was converted into a laundry and a herd of dairy cattle was introduced to provide milk, butter and cheese for the prison.","A low &lt;U+FFFD&gt;at area on the western side of the island was used for pasturing prison animals. It had stables, cowsheds, piggeries, sheep yards and a slaughter house.","by 1866 a quarantine station was established, with prisoners from the prison hulk Prosperine commuting daily to clear scrubland, sink wells and build the jetty. The island was declared a penal establishment on the 14 May 1867 with the intention of housing long-term prisoners who would be kept busy with labouring on the land.","“At &lt;U+FFFD&gt;rst, prisoners were set to work growing sugar cane, however the cane provided too many hiding places so it was replaced by lucerne and potatoes.”","; the island itself was used for farming, its rich, volcanic soil ideal for growing maize, potatoes and other vegetables.","limited area of St Helena Island and the increasing needs of the settlement resulted in the conversion of the natural environment into a manicured landscape of gardens, agricultural plots and grassed paddocks.","overcrowding in Brisbanes gaols resulted in the conversion of the buildings, originally intended for a quarantine station, into accommodation for prisoners. Prison labour was used for all activities on the island, from the construction of buildings and roadways to growing, processing and cooking of food.","The limited area of St Helena Island (166 hectares) and the increasing needs of the settlement, resulted in extensive clearing of the natural vegetation for agricultural and other development. The native vegetation was regarded as having little or no financial value as timber, or aesthetic value as shade or garden trees.","The Superintendent and the warders ran the prison in a highly efficient manner. For most of the prison’s 65 years; self-sufficiency was a necessity and profit was the product of that efficiency.","had prize Ayreshire dairy cattle that constantly won awards at the RNA show and the island’s olive groves yielded prize-winning oil at shows in Italy,","The First World War put a temporary halt to many public projects across the country, including prison reform. In 1921, however, the prison on the island of St Helena, off the coast of southern Queensland was converted to a prison farm.49 Officials at the time saw change on the island as part of the wave of reform from the south. There had been a large prison on the island since the 1860s, and as part of the conversion, the inmates were put to work dismantling the old cellblock buildings.","late 1920s and early 1930s, Patrick Roche, the Superintendent of H. M.

Others are engaged driving cane waggons and carting water;","some half-dozen are building a school house; others in the bake house, wash-house, blacksmith’s shop, and the many et ceteras that go to make up a large establishment depending upon its own re-sources for labor.","All the land suitable for cultivation, some seventy acres, is now under sugar cane. A portion - perhaps a third - of this land is good;","The island has been stripped of timber; a few trees only of the dense growth that formerly covered it are now standing. They are close to the garden of the Superintendent. A few mangrove bushes still occupy a portion of the low wet land with which the island is surrounded. The high and dry land is covered with cane; and some seven or eight acres of mulberry trees have been planted on steep banks. This total clearing of the island was adopted that there might be no cover for prisoners who attempted to escape.","cutting, carting, &amp;c., is also done by prisoners, and with so little apparent supervision that the men differed in no respect from ordinary field hands.","The whole process is educational and reformatory in a high degree, and we are glad to find from the records of the establishment that the great majority of the men discharged from it go into regular employment. Few of them return to St. Helena. Since the formation of the settlement, some 700 prisoners have been discharged. It is no ordinary satisfaction to the country to know that not three per cent. of these men have relapsed into crime. This is highly creditable to the system followed at St. Helena, which at once tends to reform the men, and learn them a useful occupation, at which they find employment as soon as they leave the island.","St. Helena is one of the most suitable establish-ments in the colonies for the reception of prisoners, and their preparation for again becoming useful members of society. At the present time the number of prisoners is below the average; there is work and accomodation for double the number - a good omen in itself, but we are at a loss to conceive why this should be the case while some of the goals of the colony have more prisoners than can be properly accommodated. These men should be drafted to St. Helena, where the opportunities for becoming useful and industrious are greater than in any other prison in the country.","The Home Secretary’s anxiety is for a site offering adequate scope for the carrying on of healthy out-door activities, such as farming, gardening, quarrying, and the like; he is a thorough believer in the open-air treatment of prisoners, and dry stat-istics justify his faith in that treatment as assisting greatly in the reformation of prisoners.","never used for convicts but opened in 1867 as Queenslandís &lt;U+FFFD&gt;rst penal establishment to house long-term, high-security male prisoners. Until then, they were crowded into cells at Petrie Terrace and spilling into the hulk Proserpine moored in the Brisbane River.","The island was all about making money for the government using free prison labour.","St Helena opened in 1867 as Queensland’s &lt;U+FB01&gt;rst penal establishment for long-term male prisoners.","St Helena was good business for the government though, as various pro&lt;U+FB01&gt;table industries were established using the abundant free labour. There were carpenters, bricklayers and masons, quarrymen, shoemakers, saddlers, tinsmiths, and labourers.","A prisoner who cut off his &lt;U+FB01&gt;nger on a knife while harvesting cane was given lighter duties.

The dire condition of colonial finances, combined with concerns for maintaining discipline, settled the future of the penal system for the next fifty years. The government hoped that St Helena could become self-sustaining and perhaps profitable. A range of trades and workshops would be introduced, and for this able-bodied men, preferably with skills, were required. By the time of the report on St Helena (1869), the government’s view was that St Helena should become the premier penal establishment for men. Brisbane Gaol would process","he Board of Inquiry (1887) reported that prisoners on St Helena were productively engaged, albeit in a narrow range of agricultural and industrial pursuits","THE HOMINY RIOTS some years ago, on account of blue-mouldy, uneatable meal being served out","THE HOMINY RIOTS some years ago, on account of blue-mouldy, uneatable meal being served out, were a very serious matter. The military had to be called in, and loaded rifles were levelled at the men on strike through the long, perpendicular iron bars which form the front enclosing barricades to the prisoners’ yards.","Better food, more liberty, and, on the .whole, a far more manly set of men are to be found in the long-time prison.","brazenly “cadged” cigarettes and “chews” when the warders’ backs were turned, and spoke in terms of such glow-ing enthusiasm of the pound of steak and quart of tea they were to get on arrival","so cleverly do the prison authorities arrange matters that St. Helena is practically self-support-ing.","In one boiler is “hominy,” or maizemeal, thick and white, and very appetising—to those that like it. In another great steam can is meat, and a third holds a plentiful supply of soup for the coming Wednesday.","ordinary prison daily ration consists of 20oz. of bread, 16oz. of meat. 6oz. of maizemeal, 12oz. of vege-tables, 1/2oz. of rice or barley, 3oz. of sugar, and 1/2oz. each of salt, tea, and soap.","In addition to this bill of fare soup is served out on Sundays and Wednesdays","Food is issued in mess-tins that hold provisions for five or six men.","Next to the kitchen is the bakehouse, and the white-capped and clean-aproned baker in charge is liter-ally between two fires, since he does his work sandwiched in between a pair of huge ovens. Here all the bread for the prison is baked, and the tables are piled up with crisp brown loaves, that look very tempting to a hungry Pressman.","I attribute the health of the inmates to their regular hours, to their regular meals, and to the out-door work which those who are not tradesmen, or gaol apologies for tradesmen, are engaged on.","During the term in the probation yard, neither tea nor sugar is allowed, but somehow it gets there just the same.","At each end are fences of high iron girders, with about six inches between them, through which a good-sized tin can be passed. These tins are attached to strings, and swing round the end of the brick walls furthest from the watching officials, filled with tea, and swing back again.","Likewise sugar finds its way to those who have friends among men on indul-gence.","The men feed in messes of five or six individuals.","One of my mess was employed at the Comptroller’s house, and he occasionally came to light with an addition to the fare in the way of jam or treacle. Another worked in the pig-aery, and generally managed to get some milk from the dairy which ad-joined his department. Another employed in the garden brought “greens,” radishes, etc., and I, who had a job for at the Superintendent’s garden, was often able to make some addition to the bill.","on Wednesdays and Sundays we had a pudding.","Surplus bread from the long-timers’ yard, sugar, suet, and whatever ingredients that could be gathered in were mixed up and sent along to the cook-house. There was much pride taken in the pudding manu-facture, and the eating of the article it-self, when it was eatable, which did not always happen, was the source of much satisfaction.","There was a prisoner in St. Helena who was employed as chief cook. He robbed the invalids in the hospital of their food, and stole the prisoners’ tea and sold it to th warders. He also MIXED FLOUR WITH THE OATMEAL which the doctor had ordered for some of the prisoners in the yards. One morning the prisoners complained to the chief war-der that flour was mixed with their oatmeal. The chief warder immediately sent for the chief cook prisoner and told him he had mixed flour with the prisoners’ oatmeal. Of course the prisoner denied it, and told the chief warder that he would prove that the oatmeal was not adulter-ated, by showing some raw oatmeal which was in the kitchen. “All right,” said the chief warder, “and then I will believe you.” The prisoner then proceeded to the kitchen and shortly afterwards returned with a bag half full of oatmeal. “Give it to me,” said the chief warder, and, continuing, “now I am certain that you mixed flour with the oatmeal, because you should not have any oatmeal before the rations are issued for the day. The very fact of your having oatmeal before the issue of the rations is proof positive that the prisoners did not receive for tea and breakfast what the doctor had ordered them.”","The members of the clique are said to be kept supplied by the warders and others in authority with milk and other luxuries which are concealed in the convenient scrap buck mentioned above until they find their way to those for whom they are intended.","Some of the clique send their dinner meat regularly to the kitchen to be fried for their supper. Their potatoes are baked for them, and their plates are half filled with gravy.","They had tobacco, and could pay the prisoners in the kitchen. If you are not installed in their good graces, you cannot obtain the tobacco to get these things done.","prisoners on St. Helena are divided into two classes, A and B. Each has a yard and surroundings quite apart from the other. The new arrivals are all put with the lower grade, and so remain for six months. If well-behaved during all that time, there is promotion to the higher grade, and tea, sugar, and tobacco are added to the supplies.","ordinary rations consist of bread, maize-meal porridge, and meat. There are several “scales” for the supply of the articles named; but all well-conducted prisoners have a sufficiency of the homely fare to satisfy, hunger","discipline is upheld considerably through the agency of the stomach and the influences of single, solitary, and dark cells.","The cells for two days, with lowest diet that sustains life, were prescribed, with an expression that “You will know better next time. “Yes, yer honor,” says No. 00, who is marched off. The others were treated somewhat similarly. The cure is perfect in the cases of 99 men in 100. Absolute stillness and the stomach treatment appeal powerfully in the cause of good behavior.","The exceptional 100th was brought before the superintendent on that morning. He was a great big man who would be powerful were he not sham-bling in form; an old hand in gaol life, with a lurking eye that seemed to have a down upon all mankind. “In the quarry, yesterday,” said the warder in charge, “No. 00 was insolent; said he would rather be in the charge of any other warder than –-; and acted in a manner injurious to discipline.” In answer to the usual question, prisoner said he was unwell, and made a rambling statement in justification. His ambition is to be a leader amongst his fellows, it would appear. He submits to the yoke for a time, and “indulgences” are granted him. Then he breaks loose, and, as in the case noted, the indulgences are stopped, and a single cell prescribed.","At 6, bell rings for breakfast;","At 11.50, bell rings for dinner, and labor is re-sumed at 1. 5 p.m. finishes the labor of the day.","5 p.m. finishes the labor of the day.

Each kit contains the portions of five or six men who mess to gether, and five or six kits are brought into each yard.","Hominy is described as simply vile and is never touched by men on indulgence allowance, (sugar and full ration of bread) unless it is to spread on some bread saved from dinner the day before.","Indulgence allowance is only granted after the probationary period is over, and this probationary period depends on previous convictions. If there are two previous convictions the period is six months, if three, nine months and so on.","Tea and sugar are served out with full indulgence allowance.","dinner bell rings at 11.50 - ¾lb. of meat, about the same of bread, and 1/2lb. of sweet potatoes, which are always stringy and generally more wood than potato.","Supper consists of HOMINY AND WATER, except tor the indulgence men who also have tea and sugar.","Seven days light cells means that a man is kept that number of days IN A SMALL CELL for 23 hours out of the 24, and is only allowed half-rations. He is allowed one hour’s exercise in the probation yard, which is about 25 yards long by six or seven yards wide. Only one man is allowed to exercise at a time, and the warders on probation duty take it week about to look after them.","Confinement IN THE DARK CELLS is for the same number of hours as in the ordinary cells - 23 out of 24, and the loss of indulgence is at the same rate. In this connection days on remand before punishment count as punishment.","If a man goes sick he is placed in a small cell on sick ration, that is, about half the full ration. He is allowed no tea, and— greatest deprivation of all— no book. An old warder doses him with oil (the only’ medicine) if he considers he requires a dose. If the patient’s temperature rises above a certain point he is sent to the hospital for treatment, otherwise he may remain in the cells for months.","The commissariat department at St. Helena causes much complaining. Until two months ago, when three supply boats were put on, the meat was constantly rotten, so rotten that it could be noticed as soon as the men entered the yard.","The meat is taken from the boat to the butchers, weighed, and the best of it is taken for the superintendent, the comp-troller, and the chief warder. Then what is to go to the prisoners is chopped up for the messes according to scale, under the supervision of the warder in charge and chief cook. It is put into nets, THROWN INTO A BARROW and wheeled to tho kitchen, where seven convict cooks are employed. There it is generally boiled, and the cooks can take what they want for themselves and their pals, as the warder in charge never sees the meat cooked. When cooked, the warder in charge sees it put on the trollies for the yards.","men constantly complain of short weight. They take the meat up, and it is weighed, and a ration has been found to scale only 8oz., bone included, instead of 16. This reduction in weight is said to be due to cooking, that is all the satisfaction the men get. If the meat is bad — that is, so bad as to be noticeable, charcoal is thrown into the boiler. This has the effect of taking the smell away, but of course does not affect the QUALITY OF THE MEAT If, however, the men take the meat to the superintendent with a complaint, he simply sniffs it, says “there’s no smell,” and the men are sent away without any redress.","stereotyped answer is always returned to the complainants, “It’s as good as you’d got outside.”","tainted meat was taken by the prisoners before the doctor, who admitted it was not good, but nothing was done. The trouble seems to lie in the fact that the warder who supervises the kitchen has also charge of the bakery. He is a baker by trade, and it Is easy to see where he would be likely to put in most of his time. In many cases he cannot SATISFACTORILY SUPERVISE both departments.","The scale laid down is acknow-ledged to be ample, if only it is properly cooked and served out, and no filching occurs.","A striking example of the extent to which favoritism is carried is afforded by the “pet crowd.” These men do simply as they like. They have two good meat meals a day, butter, milk, and so on.","When prisoners take their bread up and complain to the superintendent or the chief warder, they are often threatened with the cells for making frivolous complaints.","I have seen bread made at St. Helena that the pigs would not eat, and I have seen batches of bread burnt in order that it would not be seen. It is surprising to see the amount of bread and dough which has been burnt in the firebox or dumped up on top of the oven.","On one occasion the bread was very raw. The superintent, on his round at 10 o’clock the next day, told the warder baker to cook the bread better.","This warder baker is in charge of the kitchen, having under his charge nine prisoners. The way he abuses these men is a disgrace to the establishment. This warder has locked up more men during the 12 months he has been on St. Helena than all the rest of the warders","As the baker warder takes the tucker down the back of the yards, he is reponsible for all prisoners’ food, and in seeing that it is cooked, and that every man gets his allowance. His chief hobby, however, is to see that everything is polished before 10 o’clock in the morning, when the superintendent goes his rounds. All the kitchen utensils are polished outside, but inside they are dirty. Tucker is always cold when it reaches the yards, and unless a man has the constitution of a pig he can not eat the tucker. The rations are issued from the store every morning for the stockade kitchen, but the prisoners do not get their full allowance of tea.","There is a scale of rations drawn up by the Government for prisoners at St. Helena, yet Dr. Dods reduced the allowance of rice from 4oz. to 2oz. on or about March 22, 1911. Surely, if a scale is drawn up by the Government, the doctor should not have the power to reduce it.","A party of soldiers and warders started in pursuit of the runa-ways, who managed to secrete themselves in a thick scrub. Their pursuers, however, placed themselves in such a manner as to be able to discover any attempt on their part to leave their lurking place to procure food; they were, consequently, captured without re-sistance early on Saturday morning.","native vegetation was cleared by the prisoners, who planted crops there.

While this came about through necessity, it also resulted in economic profit.","The early years saw prisoners clearing native vegetation, planting crops and constructing buildings. The island’s resources were used wherever possible - buildings were constructed from sandstone blocks quarried from the southern flats and bricks moulded from island clay mixes. A lime kiln was constructed to burn coral for cement. Maize and vegetable crops, supplemented with sheep and cattle herds, provided much of the island residents’ food requirements. The most successful island produce included sugar cane and award-winning Ayrshire dairy cattle. Olive oil produced from the island’s olive groves also won prizes in Italy.","14th of May 1867, the Governor of Queensland signed a proclamation declaring the island “a place whereat offenders under the order of hard labour may be detained”. St Helena became Queensland’s showpiece prison. John MacDonald was the first Superintendent with a staff of five and a military guard of 12 officers. Opening with 60 prisoners, the number of inmates soon increased to 140, rising to 300 persons by 1869.","By 1900 the St Helena Establishment accommodated 330 prisoners and operated as a self-sufficient unit. The prisoners were taught carpentry, boot making, tailoring, tinsmithing, bread making, and butchery. Vegetables thrived in the rich soil. The sugar mill crushed locally grown sugar. The most successful outcomes were the sugar cane, the growing of olives, and the prize-winning Ayrshire dairy herd, introduced in 1892.","once an example of a most successful prison institution, by 1920, problems were arising. The prison was ageing. There was the danger of fire. The buildings were of 19th-century design and did not accommodate new ideas in prison reform. Families of the warders had been moved to the mainland by 1890, which caused dissatisfaction amongst the staff.","Although St Helena Island held some of the state’s worst felons, it was considered a model prison – the isolation, high levels of security and discipline and good management resulted in its self-suf&lt;U+FB01&gt;ciency and pro&lt;U+FB01&gt;tability.","St Helena Island’s prison ran for more than 60 years, and was considered one of the foremost penal establishments at the time.","Under McDonald’s care the prison was described by newspaper journalists as being of the highest standard with clean, healthy prisoners engaged in constructive enterprises that provided them with excellent opportunities for self improvement. The aim of self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ciency was re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ected in the process by which new prison buildings were constructed when they were needed. Plans were prepared by several long-serving prisoners to the requirements of the Superintendent, the government architect not being employed. The materials were obtained on the island when possible.","The scrub was not suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient to meet the demand for building timber, but the island stone and the lime extracted from neighbouring coral reefs provided raw materials for many of the structures. The lime was burned in a kiln constructed on the island by 1869 using bricks and the local stone. Later, when the sugar mill was operational, the lime produced was used for settling the vegetable matter suspended in the sugar syrup.","One of the most successful early enterprises undertaken on the island was the growing and processing of sugar. McDonald trained himself in the processes involved and the mill was considered something of a wonder in its own right. The crushing rollers were horse-driven and hand fed by the prisoners. The syrup was gravity fed into vats for boiling down and crystallisation. The &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nal product was a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ne golden coloured sugar of table quality which was used, not only by other government institutions, but was sold commercially. Both cane and sugar won many awards at the annual International Exhibition. The cane served other useful functions on the island, the trash providing fuel for the warders’ &lt;U+FFFD&gt;res.","By the early twentieth century conditions had changed once more under the superintendence of James Ryan and visitors to the island extolled its virtues at length. It was described as the ‘pearl of Moreton Bay’ and ‘the garden of beauty’. Such descriptions aroused public interest and in 1912 a campaign was mounted by the Moreton Bay League for the closure of the prison and the conversion of the island into a place of public recreation. The Government quashed this movement by announcing plans for a new, more substantial prison on St Helena, but this did not proceed and in 1921 it was decided to close the prison and make the island a prison farm. Most of the inmates were removed to Boggo Road Gaol and those who remained were occupied with the demolition of most of the gaol’s infrastructure, including fences, stockade walls, workshops and other buildings.","At the time, St Helena was considered a model high-security prison.","The Superintendent and the warders ran the prison in a highly efficient manner.

Few of them return to St. Helena. Since the formation of the settlement, some 700 prisoners have been discharged. It is no ordinary satisfaction to the country to know that not three per cent. of these men have relapsed into crime. This is highly creditable to the system followed at St. Helena, which at once tends to reform the men, and learn them a useful occupation, at which they find employment as soon as they leave the island.","St. Helena is one of the most suitable establish-ments in the colonies for the reception of prisoners, and their preparation for again becoming useful members of society. At the present time the number of prisoners is below the average; there is work and accomodation for double the number - a good omen in itself, but we are at a loss to conceive why this should be the case while some of the goals of the colony have more prisoners than can be properly accommodated. These men should be drafted to St. Helena, where the opportunities for becoming useful and industrious are greater than in any other prison in the country.","self-funded penal settlement, had a commercial grove of olive trees in the early 1900’s.","St Helena was good business for the government though, as various pro&lt;U+FB01&gt;table industries were established using the abundant free labour.

The dire condition of colonial finances, combined with concerns for maintaining discipline, settled the future of the penal system for the next fifty years. The government hoped that St Helena could become self-sustaining and perhaps profitable. A range of trades and workshops would be introduced, and for this able-bodied men, preferably with skills, were required. By the time of the report on St Helena (1869), the government’s view was that St Helena should become the premier penal establishment for men.

This contributed to their suffering inside prisons, and Aboriginal deaths in custody were an issue from the earliest days of colonisation.","In 1853 a Brisbane judge commented on the conditions in Sydney’s Cockatoo Island prison: ‘It was a painful consideration that the punishment at Cockatoo was felt ten times more severely by the blacks than by the whites, and most of them die. Recently, one who had sentence of death commuted, and was sent there, suffered most acutely, and died in seven weeks.

Fairholme (1856:312) writes: On the coast of Moreton Bay the natives live principally on fish, and the arrival of the flying foxes on the little island of St. Helena is hailed by them as a change of diet. The flights occur only in the warmer months of the year… Petrie (1975:89) also remembers: St. Helena was a great camping place for them [flying fox] in those days, and the blacks from Wynnum used to go across in their canoes to catch them there, watching for calm weather both to go and return.","midden shells which previously overlaid the beachrock were probably burnt in the prison lime kiln.

Of similar stature to the French emperor Napoleon Bonparte, he became known among the British as Napoleon. Napoleon “borrowed” a steel axe in Dunwich and was exiled to Noogoon (“place of the flying fox” as the island was called by the Quandamooka people, or Green Island 2) for his crime.","It took him only three days to build a canoe and escape, but it was long enough for the island to be named after St Helena, the island of Napoleon’s imprisonment.","Aboriginal middens record that local people visited the island to hunt dugongs and flying-foxes and to gather shellfish. The island did not receive the name “St Helena” until 1828. A story is told that an Aboriginal man known as Napoleon stole an axe on North Stradbroke Island. Like his namesake, Napoleon Bonaparte, he was exiled to another island, thereafter called St Helena. His exile lasted only as long as it took to build a canoe and paddle back.","Originally the local Aboriginal tribes named the island Noogoon (place of the flying fox) due to the roosting of the flying foxes on the island.","Eulope, the Turrwan (or chieftain) of the Nunakal clan of the Quandamooka (Moreton Bay) people, resisted the European intruders when they arrived at Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island. As Eulope’s physical stature was similar to that of the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, Eulope became known among the British military as “Napoleon”. As the fable goes, in 1827, Napoleon of Stradbroke Island “borrowed” a steel axe in Dunwich and was exiled to Noogoon for his crime. Henceforth, the island became known as St Helena, the name of the exile home of Napoleon Bonaparte.","Eulope (c. 1800–c. 1840), headman of the Quandamooka (Jandai) people, came from Stradbroke Island","In stature and facial appearance he was said to have resembled Napoleon Bonaparte. Perhaps for this reason, but more likely because of ‘his daring courage and opposition to the military when they … took possession of Amity Point’ (Colonial Times 1850, 4), the first colonial settlement on Stradbroke Island, British soldiers knew him as ‘Napoleon,’ ‘Bonaparte,’ or ‘Boney.’","In 1827 Eulope apparently threw a spear at a prison guard and stole a steel axe from Dunwich, a second military post on Stradbroke Island. As punishment, and because the Dunwich soldiery had noted his rebellious tendencies, Captain Patrick Logan exiled him to Noogoon, an uninhabited island in Moreton Bay. In various letters, Logan began referring to Noogoon as ‘St Helena’ in mocking reference to the place of Emperor Napoleon’s imprisonment. By the mid-nineteenth century, this name was in regular use for the island.","Unbeknown to Logan, Eulope’s imprisonment on Noogoon only lasted three days. Eulope knew the island very well, as it was a regular resort for his people for turtle and flying fox hunting, and for harvesting tulipwood (used for spears). He ‘simply stripped a sheet of bark, sewed both ends, and paddled back to Stradbroke’ (Meston 1903, 8) where he was able to keep his identity hidden for a time. Various resistance activities were subsequently organised, probably by Eulope, culminating in the Battle of ‘Narawai (near Moongalba) in around 1830 in which a dozen or so British soldiers and convicts were lured into swamps to fight Eulope’s warriors. Eventually, the British conceded defeat and called a truce.","Eulope was ‘cunning, elusive and of superb physique’ (Telegraph 1931, 12). He was so quick, wiry, muscular, and skilled that he regularly beat Aboriginal warriors from other groups who were much bigger than himself, including the famous Lockyer-region resistance leader Old Moppy. Around 1835, accompanied by one hundred warriors, Eulope was part of a traditional battle-tournament near Zillmere (Brisbane) in which he soundly defeated Old Moppy, temporarily breaking a long-standing alliance between the Quandamooka and Lockyer peoples.","Aboriginal histories of Noogoon Located in Moreton Bay about 6 kilometres from the mouth of the Brisbane River, St Helena Island is 88 hectares in area and rises to 21 metres above sea level with closest landfall being Mud and Green Islands","known to the Quandamooka Aboriginal people as Noogoon.","St Helena Island sits within the social and cultural environments of Quandamooka, which are the waters and lands of the Greater Moreton Bay region of South-East Queensland.","Archaeological investigations have revealed that Aboriginal people visited Noogoon seasonally to exploit its resources for over 2,500 years.","Reaching Noogoon by island-hopping signi&lt;U+FB01&gt;cant distances, canoeing, swimming and walking across sand bars, these stays were of a short-term nature, with midden heaps providing an extraordinary visual and physical record of Aboriginal people’s ongoing visitation and management of the island and its nearby terrestrial as well as marine resources.","Quandamooka Aboriginal people held religious beliefs that involved close, often collaborative relationships with marine animals, including a close &lt;U+FB01&gt;shing relationship with dolphins.14 These middens record a rich diet that included sharks, &lt;U+FB01&gt;sh and &lt;U+FB02&gt;ying foxes, as well as lizards, dugong and turtles.","Noogoon and the waters around it were &lt;U+FB01&gt;rst mapped by Europeans in 1799 when British explorer Matthew Flinders anchored the sloop the Norfolk alongside the small heavily timbered island on the evening of the 19 July while performing a two-week survey of what is now known as Moreton Bay. Noting the mangrove forests and mud&lt;U+FB02&gt;ats that surrounded Noogoon on his survey chart, Finders observed the island’s height and ‘dark and luxuriant’ foliage relative to other nearby islands.","March 1828, an Aboriginal man called Eulope, but known to colonists as ‘Napoleon’, was caught stealing an axe at Dunwich on Stradbroke Island. He was named Napoleon due to his leadership and supposed physical resemblance to the famous French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, who was exiled after a defeat in 1815 to a remote British-held island in the South Atlantic Ocean called St Helena, where he died a prisoner.","Thinking detention on an ‘isolated’ island in the middle of Moreton Bay the best way to punish the ‘black Napoleon’, Commandant Logan exiled Eulope on Noogoon. However, Eulope spent less than three days on Noogoon making a bark canoe before paddling and navigating the signi&lt;U+FB01&gt;cant distance across the bay to his family on Stradbroke Island.27 Following this legendary act of de&lt;U+FB01&gt;ance, by 1848 the island was known to European settlers as St Helena.","Escapes were few, with some reports highlighting the threat of sharks: ‘One of the escaping inmates was reportedly taken by sharks, an Aboriginal man known to his community on Mornington Island as Kitikir, but to the Queensland press as “Burketown Peter”’.60 Transported down to St Helena and imprisoned for the murder of a missionary, the press surrounding Kitikir’s escape was sensational, &lt;U+FB01&gt;rst reporting his swimming escape: Still at Large.

Diving from the raft, he did not return to the surface and was probably taken by sharks.62 However, his cause of death remains uncertain, with later reports suggest that Kitikir had been shot while escaping, with the ‘son of a former warder on the island, cryptically, perhaps knowingly, stating: “I think he might have been despatched by other means”.’63","the alarm raised at St. Helena on Tuesday was caused by two aboriginal convicts rushing from the gang in which they were working, and concealing themselves in a clump of cane. They would not answer to the repeated calls of the warders, so that the “alarm” was given and a search for the fugi— tives commenced. The gangs at work in the fields and in the boiling-house were marched to their quarters, and the whole force at the disposal of the Superintendent, Mr. McDonald, was directed to the capture of the runaways, Watcbes were also set to prevent them escap— ing from the island.","The men are named Sandy and Johnny respectively, the former undergoing a life sentence for a criminal assault on a woman on the Gympie road to Maryborough, and the latter a sentence of seven years’ penal servitude for abetting in the crime.

It is not unlikely they have succeeded in their design, unless the sharks have interfered to prevent it being carried to a successful issue.","The name of the island recalls an incident in 1828 regarding an Aborigine nicknamed Napoleon for his resemblance to the French general who was exiled on the island of St Helena. ‘Napoleon’, whose real name was Nugoon, stole an axe from the government stores at Dunwich and was ‘exiled’ by the authorities on one of the Green Islands, however, he constructed a canoe from materials on the island and returned to Dunwich within days. For many years the name of the island alternated between St Helena and Nugoon, however it was the former which gained of&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cial recognition.","A large midden extending across the southern portion of the island is evidence of the island’s early use by Aborigines.","The Queensland Corrective Services (QCS) website describes that, though not declared a penal settlement in 1867, the island was &lt;U+FFFD&gt;rst used as a prison in 1826 by Commandant Patrick Logan.

In the early nineteenth century, it was briefly used as a place of confinement for an Aboriginal man who had repeatedly run foul of colonial officials. To British eyes, the man’s profile bore a resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte’s, so the island became known as St Helena, after the island on which the French leader was imprisoned.","Eulope, the Turrwan or chieftain of the Nunakal clan of the Quandamooka (Moreton Bay) people, had fought against the military when they arrived at his homeland at Amity Point on North Stradbroke.

For example, several amendments made to the Queensland Heritage Act in recent times have not resulted in improvements to archaeological practice and even weakened the situation. The requirement for practitioners to seek government approval for historical archaeological survey and excavation was removed in 2008. Ever since then potentially destructive work has been carried out with limited regulatory supervision. On the other hand, some temporary protection was added for previously unrecorded archaeological sites located during the course of development or other ground disturbing works. This requirement, however, is fundamentally flawed and relies on those with the least to gain from compliance with the legislation (i.e. a developer or someone hunting historic artifacts for profit such as a bottle collector) to admit they have found or even destroyed important archaeological evidence. Recent changes to legislative requirements in other Australian jurisdictions, such as in New South Wales, have arguably weakened the ability to protect important places and this should act as a warning. Legislation has been and will continue to be developed in reference to political motivations that do not necessarily correlate with the wishes and desires of the archaeological community.","inclusion of legislative provisions in the Queensland Heritage Act for local heritage registers was a step in the right direction even though content requirements were broad and local governments could opt out of including them in their core planning schemes.","local heritage overlays. A standard planning practice in Victoria, these overlays contain information on a range of heritage places, including historical archaeological places, deemed of State or local significance (State Government of Victoria 2010). Greater cooperation between the different levels of government and significant capacity building of development assessment officers and plan-ners within local government would be required to achieve such a goal.","The heritage register is primarily used by heritage professionals for understanding the history and heritage values of specific places or areas under study.","A search of comparable registers across Australia shows that Queensland is in this way performing well in the protection of historical archaeological places through their identification, significance assessment and registration on the State heritage register (Fig. 2). Since 2003, an average of seven places with historical archaeological values has been added to the Queensland heritage register each year, averaging about 17 % of annual registrations. This is close to double the average number added in the preceding decade. The main reason behind the increase is the addition of a specific archaeological place category to the register in 2008. Since then 14 places have been entered specifically for their historical archaeological values. Queensland also recog-nizes that archaeology is not just a compliance related activity and proactive identification and assessment programs for historical archaeological places have been undertaken in some parts of the State.","The heritage register is also far from representative of the full range of historical archaeological place types that are known to survive in Queensland. The majority of entries relate to Queensland’s mining heritage, including remnants of the prolific gold, tin, copper, silver, and rare metals industries of central and north Queensland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Fig. 4). Their recognition is due to a number of studies on the mining theme initiated by the Queensland Government during the 1990s rather than any deliberate effort to protect such places (Jane Lennon and Associates and Pearce 1996; Kerr 1992; Pearson 1994).","enter in the heritage register places associated with the past control and discrimination of Indigenous peoples, such as the former Taroom Aboriginal Settlement in central Queensland (Department of Environment and Resource Management 2010; State of Queensland 2012a) and Fantome Island (Department of Environment and Resource Management 2011; State of Queensland 2012b).","general public is overtly concerned about “historic architecture” and “irreplaceable” heritage places, such as national icons, with no recognition given to the wide range of archaeological resources found throughout the country (McDonald 2006, p. 9).

Oysters also abound","some people who hold the view that the same object could be attained, and with more benefit to the State and the commu-nity, by the utilisation of prison labor on work outside the gaols.","been suggested that prison labor from St. Helen-a could be used for the reclama tion and improvement of some of the islands of Moreton Bay, in brushing the under-growth, forming approaches, erecting ac-commodation sheds, etc.","a request by a Northern local authority to utilise prison labor on tho roads, was peremptorily refused by the Home Secretary, who forecasted that such a scheme would inspire a great outcry if adopted in Queensland, and that even those who in theory might favor it, would join in the outcry if it was put into practice. He believes, he says, in treating prisoners in a manner that will conduce to their reformation, but. has set his face against their em-ployment at work outside the precincts of the gaols.","In 1866, a quarantine station was built on St Helena, but within a year, it was realised it would be much better use solving the problem of what to do with all the prisoners.","There were some grand plans for its future, including a golf course and rabbit hunting, but in the end, it was leased as a cattle farm, and was a dairy in the 1950s. As the knowledgeable Andre explains: “It was forgotten and so it survived through the ’60s and ’70s. The Deen Brothers didn’t have a boat.” The reference is to the Deen “all we leave behind is the memories” Brothers whose company was famous for the demolition of a number of heritage sites, such as the Belle Vue hotel, for the Joh Bjelke Petersen government during the 1970s. And finally, in 1979, St Helena was declared national park","Early attempts by the Moreton Bay League to turn the island into a recreation destination were defeated by the depression years. In 1939 the Brisbane City Council handed ownership to the Lands Department, which allowed various graziers to lease the land.","1st of December 1933, the island was opened to the general public for recreation under the auspices of Brisbane City Council. A passenger service was established from Wynnum Jetty. However, these were the Depression years, and the venture failed, closing in 1934.","island was handed back to the State Government in 1939 and leased as a dairy farm until 1973. 4IP Radio Ipswich leased part of North Point to build a radio station in 1974. The island was gazetted as a National Park on the 1st of October 1978, then as a historical area on the 7th of October 1979. The first Park Ranger was appointed in 1981.","October 1986, a new, long jetty was opened on the southwestern point. A horse-drawn wagon conveyed visitors up the hill to view the remains until 1996 when the local Rotary Club took over with their diesel-powered train. This service could not be run at a profit and closed in 2002. The Queensland Prison and Penal Historical Association was formed in 2004 to provide tour guides, compile research, and promote the island. Today the island is under the care of the State Government’s Parks and Wildlife Department, with the park warden operating out of Fort Lytton. Some excellent tours depart from Many Boat Harbour.","after the penal establishment closed, this swimming enclosure was central to thwarted development plans seeking to create a health resort or tourist destination in Moreton Bay","By the early twentieth century conditions had changed once more under the superintendence of James Ryan and visitors to the island extolled its virtues at length. It was described as the ‘pearl of Moreton Bay’ and ‘the garden of beauty’. Such descriptions aroused public interest and in 1912 a campaign was mounted by the Moreton Bay League for the closure of the prison and the conversion of the island into a place of public recreation. The Government quashed this movement by announcing plans for a new, more substantial prison on St Helena, but this did not proceed and in 1921 it was decided to close the prison and make the island a prison farm. Most of the inmates were removed to Boggo Road Gaol and those who remained were occupied with the demolition of most of the gaol’s infrastructure, including fences, stockade walls, workshops and other buildings.","n 1933 the island became the responsibility of Brisbane City Council whose plans for the island included golf courses, landing strips, holiday cabins and tennis courts. Of these, only a dance hall and kiosk were erected and a few trees planted to provide shelter at the picnic area near the wharf. A regular ferry service was supplied to carry people to the island, but the scheme proved uneconomic. In 1939 the Council surrendered its control of the island and a dairy farm was established once more.","When the penal settlement closed, the island was handed over to the Brisbane City Council and was briefly promoted as a pleasure resort (1933-34). This venture did not prosper","The suggestion that St. Helena Island be made a national park was mooted as early as 1910 by the then Mayor of Brisbane. The island was the first historic site to be managed by the Department of Environment and Conservation for its historic values.","prison farm did not last long: it was closed in 1933, following significant public pressure for its removal, so that the island might be re-made into a beauty spot for boaters and picnickers.","incon— gruities that strikes the visitor to our city and its surroundings is that St. Helena, one of the most beautiful and fertile islands in Moreton Bay, should be utilised only for the purpose of a penal establishment.","Except in the cost of transferring the prisoners to a main land gaol, we cannot see any valid reason for continuing to use the island for its present purpose.","as the Home Secretary himself admits, there is greater cost in the maintenance of an island prison because of the cost of transport and loss of time for officials and other travelling-to and from the place, — to say nothing of inconvenience to mar— ried members of the prison staff.","for too long been withheld from becoming what it is so manifestly fit to be, — the leading pleasure resort of the people of Brisbane.","The wonderful fertility of the island would enable it to be transformed into a perfect garden. On the question of the use to which the island might be put, there is no occa-sion for haste. Mr. Huxham favours leasing the island to some person or company for use as a pleasure resort, for he is afraid that if the island were left to the care of the general public, it soon would be overrun with weeds.","Some time ago, a deputation of boating men asked that the Island should be converted into a pleasure resort, and we have not the slightest doubt that the boating men would soon rid Mr. Huxham of his fears about the weeds, and we have Green Island as a good example of what enterprise can do on a pretty island of Moreton Bay.","There were some grand plans for its future, including a golf course and rabbit hunting, but in the end, it was leased as a cattle farm, and was a dairy in the 1950s","July 22, 1868, T.

St Helena became Queensland’s showpiece prison. John MacDonald was the first Superintendent with a staff of five and a military guard of 12 officers.

With the `project of making St Helena a Quarantine Station being abandoned’ these buildings were converted `into convict buildings’ so as `to meet the demand for extra prison accommodation’ when it was decided to instead use the St Helena for that purpose. (134) This report also included details on the proposed accommodation on the eastern side of the island of the Military Guard who were shortly expected to commence duties: The prisoners are now engaged on these works and one of the buildings, that on the West Side of the bluff, will be ready for the reception of about 60 prisoners in the course of a week … but as it is the intention of the Government to put a military guard over the prisoners on St Helena, and no shelter being as yet available, the prison wards cannot be used until the building on the East bank has been temporarily fitted up for the reception of the guard, and this cannot be finished for some three or four weeks to come, as the roof is not yet on the building, and the work being done by prisoners, a longer time is required than if it were being done by free men. (135)","Following the receipt of approval of Governor Bowen, the role and duties of the Military Guard for St Helena on 14 May 1867 comprised: The military guard stationed at St. Helena will be under the immediate control of the NCO whose Duty it will be to co-operate with the superintendant, and do all in his power to establish the security of the prisoners by night and day, and maintain order and repress insubordination on the part of such prisoners. The NCOs in command of the military guard will act under instructions having been submitted to, and approved by, His Excellency the Governor in Council. (136)","To assist the Non-Commissioned Officers of the 50th who were placed in charge of this Military Guard, `Instructions’ were also set out during November 1867 which elaborated upon their duties while stationed at the St Helena Penal establishment: 1. The Non-Commissioned Officer will be responsible for the conduct of the men, under his charge. 2. He will see that all Standing Orders and other Instructions which may be issued from time to time, are strictly and promptly executed, and shall duly report any neglect of the same. 3. It is not desirous to lay down any precise course of conduct for the Non-Commissioned Officer, or to say how much of his time should be occupied in the actual performance of his duties, but he will at all times co-operate with the Superintendent and render every assistance in his power for the maintenance of good order and the general security of the prisoners. 4. He will feel the importance of making occasional visits to the Sentries, seeing that they are on the alert and attending to their duty. 5. He will inspect every sentry before turning him out on duty, see that he is perfectly sober, clean, correctly dressed, armed and accoutred that his rifle is loaded and capped, and that he is supplied with ten rounds of ammunition and a proportionate number of caps, all of which must be in good condition. He will then march them to their respective posts, and see that the Sentries on numbers One, Two and Three posts do duty with fixed bayonets. He will attend at every muster of the prisoners with the proper number of Sentries requited for duty. Station them at their respective posts, and see that each Sentry fully understand the instructions relating to his post. He will see that the Sentry for number `Three’ post is on duty at the time the prisoners are released from their Cells in the morning, and that he does not leave it until after the hoisting of the `All right’ signal at night. He will understand that `Night Duty’ is from the time the prisoners are locked up in the evening until they are released in the morning and will post his Sentries accordingly. Day Posts No.1. is in front of the Prison Buildings No.2. is at the south-east corner of the Yard to command a view of the south and east angles. Night Posts No.1. is in front of the Prison Buildings including the ends. No.2. is at the back of the Prison Buildings within the Yards including the Hospital and Cook House. No.3. Day Post only — is at the Stone Quarry on the beach, to command a view of all the south end of the Island and a portion of the West Side. (137)","Privates of the 50th who would serve as part of the Military Guard were also provided with lengthy and detailed `General Instructions’ for their guidance. (138) The formalisation of procedures and instructions for both NCOs and Privates serving in the Military Guard appear to have been at least partially instituted following complaints by Superintendent John McDonald about the manner these Soldiers were carrying out their tasks to the perceived detriment of operations of the Penal Establishment. On 31 October 1867, McDonald outlined to the Colonial Secretary: I have … [found] fault on several occasions with the manner in which some of the military guard performed their Duties … and more especially when on the points of landing. That orders on that post, or part of the orders is not to allow any person to land without the written order of the Colonial Secretary or Visiting Justice. But some of the military do not pay the slightest attention to the above order and their attention has been especially called to the part of their orders by the NCO in charge of the guard. On several occasions persons have been allowed to land from the steamer `Kate’ without the sentries demanding their authority and allowed to pass to the prison, the consequence is that anything might be passed to the prisoners at work all over the island. It is necessary that the above order should be strictly carried out; there is another matter I should bring before your notice, viz, of sending Lance Corporals in charge of the guard who do not appear to have the least control over their men which is not the case with a full Sergeant or full Corporal. I think if the matter was brought before the notice of the Capt. Commanding the troops, that he would cause the duties to be more satisfactorily performed in future. (139) Shortly after McDonald again followed up his concerns with another complaint about the behaviour of the Guard in December 1867: I had to complain to the visiting justice of the careless manner in which the military guard perform their duties. [This?] month I found soldiers while on guard talking with prisoners, and on one occasion I found one of them sitting down reading a book while on prison guard, there seems to be a great lack of discipline amongst the guard, as a rule, I have reason to believe that the guard conveys letters to and from prisoners on the island, and the prisoners are kept as well informed of all passing events as if they were in Brisbane Gaol! While such conduct amongst the guard which I have to depend so much upon, is allowed to be carried on, what confidence can be placed in them, there are some of the men trustworthy but, very few of them can be trusted out of sight with prisoners, I have on several occasions reported the men to the NCO in charge who very often is a L/Corporal who has little or no control over their men, if there is not soon a change for the better in the conduct of the military guard it will be quite impossible for me to carry out that order and discipline that should be carried out on the island. (140)","Correspondence in January 1868 indicates that Superintendent McDonald made a specific charge of `negligence of duty’ against a Private Poynter, one of the Military Guard who had just been released from duty on St Helena.","1 February 1868, Superintendent McDonald reported to the Colonial Secretary that the `large prison building’ under construction was expected to be completed by the end of March. Once this building was ready this would allow for the accommodation for 150 prisoners on St Helena. McDonald again used this forum of his regular report as an opportunity to again complain about the Military Guard, suggesting in the process, Warders be used to replace them: If the prisoners are increased to the above number the number of warders will also have to increase, there ought to be one warder for every ten … prisoners together with the military guard as at present established on the island. I would recommend that three warders be substituted for the military guard. The guard is of no service in charge of prisoners at work as they do not take the slightest interest, and pay little or no attention the orders I give them; and as a rule they make free with the prisoners, so that it is impossible to carry out the same discipline that could be carried out with warders. (142)","soldiers of the Military Guard were for all intents and purposes, as isolated on St Helena as the prisoners they were expected to guard. Being selected to make up the personnel for mounting this Military Guard no doubt was highly unpopular within the ranks of Brisbane’s 50th garrison. Those men selected had to contend with not only the isolation but also the strict regime of the prison administration and operation. When combined with general dissatisfaction at their placement, some of these soldiers quite naturally adversely reacted to their surrounds and duties — earning in the process the ire of Superintendent McDonald. The soldiers who made up this small Military Guard also quickly found that life on St Helena was a far cry from the facilities, opportunities and pleasures garrison life in Brisbane offered.","For those soldiers who were tasked with service on St Helena — they too had complaints of their own regarding the conditions of their accommodation and the rations they were expected to tolerate. On 3 March 1868, Lieutenant MacGregor, 50th Regiment, temporarily `Commanding Troops’, wrote to the Queensland Colonial Secretary about certain grievances of the men who had served in the Military Guard detachment: I have the honour to bring to your notice the aged and dirty state of the beds provided for the military guard at St. Helena, and beg to request that you will cause the proper authorities to provide new ones at once. There being no change of beds, or bedcovers, nor means of [?] them I am unable to cast any blame on the soldiers of the guard. I have also to request your attention to the inferior quality of the tea ration which is far below that required by the ordinary Commissariat contract. (143)","On 17 June 1868, Captain Eden, the officer now commanding the 50th Regiment detachment in Brisbane, in a detailed correspondence, also brought a variety of complaints of the men of the Military Guard before the Colonial Secretary. With a view to its receiving your early attention I … bring to your notice that the Detachment 50th Regt, last returned from St. Helena … on the 8th Inst. complain in a body of the inferior quality of the rations issued to them at that station. I understand them to say among other things that for the space of their days they had no Bread whatever, and that no potatoes were issued to them for, I think, a period of eight days. I am informed that in the first case a certain quantity of some description of flour was presented to them, in place of Bread with a suggestion that they could make their own … The scale for the Issue of Rations to the Troops at St Helena, if I remember right, was authorized by yourself, and provides for a daily portion of bread and potatoes for the soldiers. I also … bring to your notice a pretty general complaint from the soldiers (and noncomd. Officers in charge) that have of late been stationed at St Helena regarding Mr. Turnkey Hamilton, who, by the way, I understand to be the Issuer above alluded to — his manner to them they designate as most irritating and annoying … I can quite believe this complaint to be exaggerated by irritation, still, judging from the well known character of many of my informants, I am convinced that it contains sufficient grounds to warrant … the attention you may find it to deserve. (144)","complaints raised by the men were of offensive language or manner of the Chief Warder, James Hamilton, towards them; `the total, or partial absence of Sentry Boxes’ for the protection of sentries during inclement weather; and `great complaints concerning an offensive cesspool’ located near one guard post. But it was the actual duties that these soldiers were expected to perform, and the numbers of men from the Military Guard used as sentries at any one time that was also of concern to Captain Eden: … the fact that they are a great deal to arms, and, as I rather think, not sanctioned by the `Queens Regulations’. With respect to this I mentioned my objection to Mr Superintendent Macdonald, stating I could not allow the use of five sentries from a guard of but eleven effective men. My objection appears to have had no use yet with him, for I have ascertained that he regards the military Regulations, as expressed through me, with no attention whatever, and still continues to employ more sentries than the Guard can properly furnish. (145)","another aspect to the role of the Military Guard on St Helena was the unenviable position in which soldiers might at any time find themselves called upon the fire on prisoners. Such a situation was a glaring potential conflict between Army and civil jurisdiction, as it was liability in case of death or injury that might be inflicted by a soldier. Such a situation was a glaring potential conflict between military and civil jurisdiction since whatever action a soldier took in performing his duty which may have resulted in the death or injury of a prisoner did not exempt him from prosecution under either codes of law. In June 1868, Captain Eden requested through Visiting Justice Barron, that the `instructions for the guidance of the Military Guard’ be amended by the Government so as to provide more detail than those already in use on St Helena. After receiving the Government’s response, Captain Eden replied on 16 June: I believe it to be necessary, before these instructions can be put in force, that some addition to them should be made, that shall regard the necessity for using the loaded Rifles put into the soldiers hands, and explicitly set down when, and from whom an order to fire on a `prisoner’ shall be considered valid, and an exemption from any ulterior consequences that might arise out of such as act, the result of which was the wounding or death of a Prisoner. I am convinced that some rule providing for an emergency of this sort should be laid down and thus tend towards the greater efficiency of the St Helena Detachment. Rule No.11, of `General Instructions’ only forbids the discharge of a Rifle without the Superintendents sanction with a view to prevent any false alarm, and, consequently, denies the Soldier that means of giving warning when a real alarm is necessary, which, it is to be presumed, may occur [soon?] at St. Helena. (146)","the soldiers who were employed as part of St Helena’s Military Guard detachment during 1867-69, these Imperial troops nonetheless played an important temporary prison staffing role while the penal establishment was being constructed. (147) The prison stockade was not finished until 1868, during which time these soldiers were especially important for mounting guards over the various prisoner work gangs and manning strategic posts on the island.","Amongst the findings of the 1869 Select Committee into expenditure and management on St Helena, exists a breakdown of the annual costs involved with the Military Guard: Original payment, by Government, for fifteen privates and one non-commissioned officer—in all sixteen men—at 40 [pounds sterling] per annum: Total = 640 [pounds sterling] 0s. 0d. Extra allowance to fifteen privates for acting as a penal guard, at 1s. per diem: Total = 273 [pounds sterling] 15s. 0d. Extra allowance to one non-commissioned officer, for penal guard, at 2s. 6d. per diem: Total = 45 [pounds sterling] 12s. 6d.

The 50th detachment subsequently embarked aboard the troopship Himalaya on 10 March, departing Moreton Bay on 11 March. (150)","In stature and facial appearance he was said to have resembled Napoleon Bonaparte. Perhaps for this reason, but more likely because of ‘his daring courage and opposition to the military when they … took possession of Amity Point’ (Colonial Times 1850, 4), the first colonial settlement on Stradbroke Island, British soldiers knew him as ‘Napoleon,’ ‘Bonaparte,’ or ‘Boney.’","In 1827 Eulope apparently threw a spear at a prison guard and stole a steel axe from Dunwich, a second military post on Stradbroke Island. As punishment, and because the Dunwich soldiery had noted his rebellious tendencies, Captain Patrick Logan exiled him to Noogoon, an uninhabited island in Moreton Bay. In various letters, Logan began referring to Noogoon as ‘St Helena’ in mocking reference to the place of Emperor Napoleon’s imprisonment. By the mid-nineteenth century, this name was in regular use for the island.","Unbeknown to Logan, Eulope’s imprisonment on Noogoon only lasted three days. Eulope knew the island very well, as it was a regular resort for his people for turtle and flying fox hunting, and for harvesting tulipwood (used for spears). He ‘simply stripped a sheet of bark, sewed both ends, and paddled back to Stradbroke’ (Meston 1903, 8) where he was able to keep his identity hidden for a time. Various resistance activities were subsequently organised, probably by Eulope, culminating in the Battle of ‘Narawai (near Moongalba) in around 1830 in which a dozen or so British soldiers and convicts were lured into swamps to fight Eulope’s warriors. Eventually, the British conceded defeat and called a truce.","A bakehouse, wash house, kitchen, punishment cells and a convalescent ward for sick prisoners were also built. On the rising ground behind these buildings, a large timber structure housed store rooms, doctors rooms, clerks rooms, quarters for twelve military personnel and one of&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cer, and accommodation for ten warders.

In the same week that the new Brisbane prison opened, it was described in the Moreton Bay Courier on 5 January 1850 as being ‘not sufficiently secure’ due to careless workmanship. The decaying porphyry-block structure was repeatedly criticised throughout the 1850s as being too small, rickety, and out-of-date with new penological trends. Plans for a new gaol were delayed by the ongoing uncertainty over Separation, with the New South Wales government unwilling to spend freely in what might soon be a separate colony.","first public building to open in Brisbane following Separation was the prison on Petrie Terrace, built at a cost of £26,000","A group of prominent Toowoomba citizens, for example, petitioned against the presence of a predominately female prison in 1870","there was only one prison in the colony at the time of Separation in 1859, ten years later there were four. By the 1890s there were prisons as far north as Thursday Island and Normanton.","The prison network was supported by police gaols, which were small, police-managed facilities, larger than the usual lockups attached to police stations, and holding short-term prisoners serving two weeks or less. Police gaols could be upgraded to official prisons (or prisons downgraded to police gaols) according to local requirements and population fluctuations.","State farms, or ‘honour prisons’, are low-security facilities used to house low-risk inmates. The first of these opened at Palen Creek, south of Brisbane near the NSW border, in 1934 and was the first prison in the Commonwealth to have no security measures, relying entirely on the honour of the prisoners not to escape.","Following the decision in 1921 to use both divisions of Boggo Road for male prisoners, St Helena became a prison farm after long-term inmates prisoners were transferred to the metropolitan prison. St Helena eventually closed in December 1932.","closed in 1932 when, during the great Depression, it simply became unviable to keep it open. Production had dropped away during World War I when prisoners had to return to the mainland to cover for young men shipped off to the European battlefields. In addition, Boggo Road, which had been used as HM Prison for Women, had also been taking male prisoners since 1903.","From the 1920s, St Helena became a prison farm. Long-term prisoners were transferred to Boggo Road Gaol while the remaining prisoners dismantled the prison buildings. The prison was finally closed in December 1932.","1866 the island was chosen as a perfect site for a Queensland quarantine station. Prisoners from the hulk Proserpine, moored at the mouth of the Brisbane River, were rowed daily to work at the site, and two buildings were completed. Due to the massive overcrowding of the Brisbane Goal in Petrie Terrace at that time, new buildings on St Helena were modified for use as a goal.","The hardened prisoners were moved to Boggo Road Gaol, built in 1889. By 1920 St Helena was a prison farm. The few remaining prisoners slowly dismantled the ageing buildings. Suitable building materials were taken over to the mainland for recycling.

At the present time the number of prisoners is below the average; there is work and accomodation for double the number - a good omen in itself, but we are at a loss to conceive why this should be the case while some of the goals of the colony have more prisoners than can be properly accommodated. These men should be drafted to St. Helena, where the opportunities for becoming useful and industrious are greater than in any other prison in the country.","Except in the cost of transferring the prisoners to a main land gaol, we cannot see any valid reason for continuing to use the island for its present purpose.","Decisions were made quickly. The dire condition of colonial finances, combined with concerns for maintaining discipline, settled the future of the penal system for the next fifty years. The government hoped that St Helena could become self-sustaining and perhaps profitable. A range of trades and workshops would be introduced, and for this able-bodied men, preferably with skills, were required.

He believes, he says, in treating prisoners in a manner that will conduce to their reformation, but. has set his face against their em-ployment at work outside the precincts of the gaols.","time is within the memory of many still amongst us, when prison methods were cruelly revengeful, rather than sagaciously reformative.","With the advance-ment of civilisation, all those afflicted with criminal tendencies have been regarded as wanting special reformative treatment rather than revengeful retribution. To this end, prison methods have been entirely reformed, and penal codes have been modified, with a view to bring-ing back to the service of society those who are capable of being brought back into that widespread and necessary service.","Home Secretary, in conjunction with the Comp-troller-General of Prisons, has effected some splendid reforms in our prison sys-tem, the good results of which already are making themselves manifest. In fact the Home Secretary states that with re-gard to prison reform in connection with St. Helena prison, his officers have in-formed him that the whole temper of the prisoners has changed since the initiation of the new system.

The age of the buildings made them a fire hazard, while their 19 th century design did not accommodate new ideas for prisoner reform.","It is the earliest attempt in Queensland at providing prison facilities which were essentially self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient and aimed at providing inmates with the opportunity for self-improvement and rehabilitation.","philosophy of prisoner rehabilitation was changing from the earlier ethos of punishment and isolation. The aim was to provide prisoners with a full day of constructive activity and instruction which would equip them with life skills. In addition, the &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nancial strictures of the colony made it desirable for the prison to be as self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient as possible. McDonald showed considerable initiative and perseverance in meeting these demands.","Under McDonald’s care the prison was described by newspaper journalists as being of the highest standard with clean, healthy prisoners engaged in constructive enterprises that provided them with excellent opportunities for self improvement. The aim of self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ciency was re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ected in the process by which new prison buildings were constructed when they were needed. Plans were prepared by several long-serving prisoners to the requirements of the Superintendent, the government architect not being employed. The materials were obtained on the island when possible.","Townley enforced a more rigid discipline than McDonald and the harsh conditions on the island soon earned St Helena the nicknames of the ‘hell-hole of the Paci&lt;U+FFFD&gt;c’ and ‘Queensland’s Inferno’, although the press described it as a model prison.","By the early twentieth century conditions had changed once more under the superintendence of James Ryan and visitors to the island extolled its virtues at length. It was described as the ‘pearl of Moreton Bay’ and ‘the garden of beauty’. Such descriptions aroused public interest and in 1912 a campaign was mounted by the Moreton Bay League for the closure of the prison and the conversion of the island into a place of public recreation. The Government quashed this movement by announcing plans for a new, more substantial prison on St Helena, but this did not proceed and in 1921 it was decided to close the prison and make the island a prison farm. Most of the inmates were removed to Boggo Road Gaol and those who remained were occupied with the demolition of most of the gaol’s infrastructure, including fences, stockade walls, workshops and other buildings.","The First World War put a temporary halt to many public projects across the country, including prison reform. In 1921, however, the prison on the island of St Helena, off the coast of southern Queensland was converted to a prison farm.49 Officials at the time saw change on the island as part of the wave of reform from the south. There had been a large prison on the island since the 1860s, and as part of the conversion, the inmates were put to work dismantling the old cellblock buildings.","The whole of the new system is formed on the principle of reformation, and not         with a vindictive desire to punish, which would be to the detriment of the         recognised principle of humanitarian treatment. The scheme has proved itself to         be a very great success. It has even reached a success far beyond my         expectations.51","Roche’s former inmates expressed his relief and gratitude at doing his time at St Helena, rather than in the gaol at Boggo Road, in Brisbane. ‘One only has to visit the prison at Brisbane and see on the faces of the men the expression of dogged and sullen hatred,’","The whole process is educational and reformatory in a high degree, and we are glad to find from the records of the establishment that the great majority of the men discharged from it go into regular employment. Few of them return to St. Helena. Since the formation of the settlement, some 700 prisoners have been discharged. It is no ordinary satisfaction to the country to know that not three per cent. of these men have relapsed into crime. This is highly creditable to the system followed at St. Helena, which at once tends to reform the men, and learn them a useful occupation, at which they find employment as soon as they leave the island.","St. Helena is one of the most suitable establish-ments in the colonies for the reception of prisoners, and their preparation for again becoming useful members of society. At the present time the number of prisoners is below the average; there is work and accomodation for double the number - a good omen in itself, but we are at a loss to conceive why this should be the case while some of the goals of the colony have more prisoners than can be properly accommodated. These men should be drafted to St. Helena, where the opportunities for becoming useful and industrious are greater than in any other prison in the country.","He was rather inclined to the idea personally. He admitted that there were dangers of long imprisonment, but pointed out that the idea, underlying the system was to keep persons in confinement until they showed some indication of reformation.","Home Secretary spoke generally about our prison system. The public, we think, will agree with him in the view that imprisonment should be reformative rather than punitive.","The Home Secretary’s anxiety is for a site offering adequate scope for the carrying on of healthy out-door activities, such as farming, gardening, quarrying, and the like; he is a thorough believer in the open-air treatment of prisoners, and dry stat-istics justify his faith in that treatment as assisting greatly in the reformation of prisoners.","The bookkeeper informs us that work begins at 7 o’clock in the morning, and goes on till 11.30 a.m., when they “knock off” for dinner. At 1 p.m. they resume their la-bour, and work on till tea time at 4.30 p.m. Tea lasts for an hour, and then they are taken to their sleeping apartments, having done the eight hours manual labour required.","In one boiler is “hominy,” or maizemeal, thick and white, and very appetising—to those that like it. In another great steam can is meat, and a third holds a plentiful supply of soup for the coming Wednesday.","ordinary prison daily ration consists of 20oz. of bread, 16oz. of meat. 6oz. of maizemeal, 12oz. of vege-tables, 1/2oz. of rice or barley, 3oz. of sugar, and 1/2oz. each of salt, tea, and soap.","In addition to this bill of fare soup is served out on Sundays and Wednesdays","Food is issued in mess-tins that hold provisions for five or six men.","Next to the kitchen is the bakehouse, and the white-capped and clean-aproned baker in charge is liter-ally between two fires, since he does his work sandwiched in between a pair of huge ovens. Here all the bread for the prison is baked, and the tables are piled up with crisp brown loaves, that look very tempting to a hungry Pressman.","Dr. Wray, the Government Medical Officer, comes down once a week to visit the prisoners and see that everything is as it should be. He is usually accom-panied by the visiting Justice, Mr. Yard-wyn, who hears any complaints the men may have to make.","I attribute the health of the inmates to their regular hours, to their regular meals, and to the out-door work which those who are not tradesmen, or gaol apologies for tradesmen, are engaged on.","There are some six yards within the stockade in which prisoners are placed during the day-time, either according to the work they are doing or to their classification","on Wednesdays and Sundays we had a pudding.","At 5.30 a.m. the first bell rings at St. Helena.

In addition, Boggo Road, which had been used as HM Prison for Women, had also been taking male prisoners since 1903.","Distance and isolation enforced basic self-sufficiency. While this came about through necessity, it also resulted in economic profit.","The early years saw prisoners clearing native vegetation, planting crops and constructing buildings. The island’s resources were used wherever possible - buildings were constructed from sandstone blocks quarried from the southern flats and bricks moulded from island clay mixes. A lime kiln was constructed to burn coral for cement. Maize and vegetable crops, supplemented with sheep and cattle herds, provided much of the island residents’ food requirements. The most successful island produce included sugar cane and award-winning Ayrshire dairy cattle. Olive oil produced from the island’s olive groves also won prizes in Italy.","By 1900 the St Helena Establishment accommodated 330 prisoners and operated as a self-sufficient unit. The prisoners were taught carpentry, boot making, tailoring, tinsmithing, bread making, and butchery. Vegetables thrived in the rich soil. The sugar mill crushed locally grown sugar. The most successful outcomes were the sugar cane, the growing of olives, and the prize-winning Ayrshire dairy herd, introduced in 1892.","The men are named Sandy and Johnny respectively, the former undergoing a life sentence for a criminal assault on a woman on the Gympie road to Maryborough, and the latter a sentence of seven years’ penal servitude for abetting in the crime.

It is not unlikely they have succeeded in their design, unless the sharks have interfered to prevent it being carried to a successful issue.","Potatoes, maize and other vegetables grew very well in the rich volcanic soil. The island’s sugar mill produced about 75 tons of sugar each year.","Under McDonald’s care the prison was described by newspaper journalists as being of the highest standard with clean, healthy prisoners engaged in constructive enterprises that provided them with excellent opportunities for self improvement. The aim of self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ciency was re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ected in the process by which new prison buildings were constructed when they were needed. Plans were prepared by several long-serving prisoners to the requirements of the Superintendent, the government architect not being employed. The materials were obtained on the island when possible.","The scrub was not suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient to meet the demand for building timber, but the island stone and the lime extracted from neighbouring coral reefs provided raw materials for many of the structures. The lime was burned in a kiln constructed on the island by 1869 using bricks and the local stone. Later, when the sugar mill was operational, the lime produced was used for settling the vegetable matter suspended in the sugar syrup.","A further area was devoted to growing maize, sugar cane and vegetables for the prison. Fifty acres were cleared with the intention of planting sugar cane. This was to be processed in a sugar re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;nery on site.","One of the most successful early enterprises undertaken on the island was the growing and processing of sugar. McDonald trained himself in the processes involved and the mill was considered something of a wonder in its own right. The crushing rollers were horse-driven and hand fed by the prisoners. The syrup was gravity fed into vats for boiling down and crystallisation. The &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nal product was a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ne golden coloured sugar of table quality which was used, not only by other government institutions, but was sold commercially. Both cane and sugar won many awards at the annual International Exhibition. The cane served other useful functions on the island, the trash providing fuel for the warders’ &lt;U+FFFD&gt;res.","Following Macdonald’s departure in 1882, his successor, Capt. Townley, reduced the acreage on the island to provide only for the prison’s needs. This crop was subsequently reduced even further, until in 1890 the prison commenced purchasing sugar from external sources. The sugar mill was converted into a laundry and a herd of dairy cattle was introduced to provide milk, butter and cheese for the prison.","“At &lt;U+FFFD&gt;rst, prisoners were set to work growing sugar cane, however the cane provided too many hiding places so it was replaced by lucerne and potatoes.”","prisoners were made to learn trades, supporting the island with numerous exports such as bricks, clothes, rope, boots and sugar.","We are promised a good riddance of bad rub— bish. The Government have made up their mind to get rid of that eyesore to Brisbane — the gaol, and to remove the prisoners to St. Helena, there to cultivate sugar.","Sugar cane was grown quite extensively during the early years and a mill for crushing was erected on the island.","In 1869, the lime kiln and sugar mill were added. Sugar cane growing and processing kept the prisoners busy until the workshops were well enough established to take over as the main source of work on the Island. These trades included bootmaking, sail-making, tailoring, saddle making, tinsmithing, candle making, book-binding and carpentry. The long termers were occupied in these workshops inside the prison stockade and the trustees engaged in animal husbandry and agriculture.","commencement of another sugar-making season took us to St. Helena.","majority of them - as many as can be spared - are engaged in the field cutting cane, and in the boiling house converting the cane juice into sugar.

A portion - perhaps a third - of this land is good;","The island has been stripped of timber; a few trees only of the dense growth that formerly covered it are now standing. They are close to the garden of the Superintendent. A few mangrove bushes still occupy a portion of the low wet land with which the island is surrounded. The high and dry land is covered with cane; and some seven or eight acres of mulberry trees have been planted on steep banks. This total clearing of the island was adopted that there might be no cover for prisoners who attempted to escape.","warders can now see clear over the whole place. But this free exposure is bad for the cane. The winds come in unbroken gusts upon it, and have during the past winter converted fully one-half of the entire crop into a tangled mass of damaged and broken cane. All the varieties - Bourbon, Diard, Chigacca, Salan-gore, and Guigham - have suffered from the winds. The ribbon cane alone has withstood the storms, and promises a fair return in sugar.","Crushing was commenced about two months since;","liquor from the damaged cane is very dirty, but with careful treatment it is yielding a fine blight colored yellow sugar, at the rate of about one ton per acre.","the land is being sreplanted with ribbon cane.

Again machinery is very much in evi-dence —namely, a “stamping” machine, which, operated by a treadle, brings a sharp-edged cutter on to the leather placed upon it, and cuts out innumerable soles and heels, the size varying with the dimensions of the cutter; and a pair of heavy rollers for hardening and levelling the leather required for the boots.","Besides the trades already mentioned there are two or three others going on in the same room, such as binding brushes, and making horse rugs and tents.","Thirty prisoners are employed in room No. 1, and a score of these find employment in the boot trade.","The bookkeeper informs us that work begins at 7 o’clock in the morning, and goes on till 11.30 a.m., when they “knock off” for dinner.

The roll is called, and squads are formed, each under the care of a warder, for the various works going on. Parties are detailed for duty in the bakery, washhouse, blacksmith shop, carpentery, &amp;c.","The practice is to hoist a signal flag on the Government steamer when there is a clergyman on board desirous of holding service. The men are mustered at once, and such as desire to attend do so. The others return to their work.","Recently a large force of men was engaged making netting for kangaroo traps. This netting is made of strong rope. It is of sufficient height to prevent a kangaroo jumping over it, and the intention is to fasten the netting to trees and stakes in the form of yards, and then drive the kangaroos in the usual way. Some 1000 yards have been made, but the supply of rope has given out, and there is a stoppage in consequence. The intention is to have about three miles of netting, and to move it about and arrange it in places where effective kangaroo drives can be made. This netting is for a kangaroo association in the north.","The system followed is reclamatory and instructive rather than compulsory.","Men learn to labor and be useful there, and we have often, and in various parts of the country, met those seen in the first instance at St. Helena who are making the effort, and successfully, to respect the laws, and to labor in honesty for their living.-In this country it is a privilege that no man who has the will and health is too far gone to adopt.","The 24 hours of the day are apportioned as follows: 8 hours work, 13½ hours in cells or wards, and 2½ hours in the yards.","Work commences about 7 a.m.","ome go to their trades — saddlery, boot making, tailoring and so on, while the others go TO OUTSIDE WORK, odd jobs about the island, chipping in the fields, cart driving, and so on.","All are clad in the one garb— moleskins, cabbage-tree hat, underflannel, and twill cotton over shirt. One change of these clothes is allowed per week, except to men in billets who never get any dirty work to do— they get two changes. Every suit is branded with the wearer’s number and “St. Helena Penal Establishment.” If by chance a man gets his clothes worn or torn, he goes to the store and: gets what is known as a suit of “duck egg”clothes to wear while his own are being washed or repaired. These “duck eggs” are suits which have been condemned. They are all branded with the broad arrow.","As the men go out to work they have to SALUTE THE WARDER at the gate— St. Helena is all salutation.","billeted men are called out, and quarter of an hour afterwards, the general and gangmen go to work, saluting the warder at the gate as they pass out.","At 3.40, a flag goes up to recall the outside workers into the stockade. Five minutes afterwards a bell is rung, and the men are counted in by the warders, each man saluting the chief warder or the comp-troller. Anyone not in when the bell rings or who fails to salute is liable to punishment.","coveted positions among the prisoners are billets— vanman, buggyman, hospital men, clerks, and so on. These men are allowed to go about practically unwatched, though most of them have to attend the roll-call - some do not even HAVE TO DO THAT. In the making of these appointments, it is said the greatest favoritism is shown, and the men, knowing this, plot, mine, and countermine. “Informing” to curry favor is resorted to, and all sorts of underhand work indulged in.","they ore put to work — some on the field, and some to learn a trade, either tinsmithing, car-pentering, tailoring, bootmaking, or saddlering.","A prisoner is put into the shops. Here he is given out some work to do. He may be put at a bench to work. Unless, however, the prisoner he is next to shows him what to do, he would be a long time learn-ing what there is to learn. The trade instructors do not come and show a man as they are supposed to do.","instructors arc supposed to be tradesmen when they are appointed, yet there is the warder-baker instructor, who came to St. Helena in April, 1913, and was appointed a few weeks after on probation. He has since been appointed warder baker at St. Helena. There was a prisoner in the bakehouse as assistant before this instruct-tor came to the island. The prisoner in the bakehouse was told by the superintendent and the Comptroller-General of Prisons that he must teach the new warder how to bake,","This warder baker is in charge of the kitchen, having under his charge nine prisoners. The way he abuses these men is a disgrace to the establishment. This warder has locked up more men during the 12 months he has been on St. Helena than all the rest of the warders","value of work performed by prisoners was £18,860 of which St. Helena was credited with £12,447. At St. Helena the value of the work performed for the State overlaps by a little the total cost of salaries and upkeep.

In fact the Home Secretary states that with re-gard to prison reform in connection with St. Helena prison, his officers have in-formed him that the whole temper of the prisoners has changed since the initiation of the new system. Great improvement in their conduct, and in the way in which they were devoting themselves to their respective prison occupations has been noted and recorded.","native vegetation was cleared by the prisoners, who planted crops there. The prison food, including hominy and bread, was obtained by growing wheat, sugar cane and vegetables, and also raising sheep and dairy cattle herds.","Buildings were also constructed using local resources where possible. For example, a lime kiln opened there in 1869 to burn coral in order to make cement.","During the 1870s a number of trade workshops were erected, and some prisoners were trained as saddle makers, tinsmiths, boot makers, tailors, blacksmiths and carpenters.","island was also all about making money for the government using free prison labour. The irony was they produced Queensland Police uniforms at one stage.","Stone ruins of the blacksmith shop where leg irons were removed, the stockade, cells, a museum and accommodation for warders dot the island, each with a story to tell. And while this makes fascinating viewing for visitors it is also a reminder of a grim past, when prisoners were forbidden to speak and were flogged until skin became bone. It was a “silent island” and speaking was a serious offence","closed in 1932 when, during the great Depression, it simply became unviable to keep it open. Production had dropped away during World War I when prisoners had to return to the mainland to cover for young men shipped off to the European battlefields. In addition, Boggo Road, which had been used as HM Prison for Women, had also been taking male prisoners since 1903.","frocks (a type of jacket)","St Helena Island in Queensland, where a lime kilns stands solidly on the foreshore of a volcanic island with no limestone cliffs in sight. This lime kiln is older, having been constructed in 1869 by prisoners incarcerated on the island. They needed to create lime to produce mortar for the building of the prison walls that would eventually contain them and their product of choice was the lime rich shells and coral fragments found in the shallow waters and coral reefs surrounding the island.","St Helena’s lime kiln continuously produced large quantities of lime, with 360 bushels in the first year of 1869 and 1302 bags in 1890. So much was produced that excess lime was supplied to other Government Departments or sold in Brisbane.","process for lime burning in kilns was the same: 1. Collect or quarry the base product 2. Stack the limestone or coral/shells and firewood cut from the nearby forests in layers inside the kiln funnel. Light this and keep burning for days or weeks at a time, adding more firewood and limestone/coral as the burning progresses. 3. Lime produced dropped to the base of the funnel where it was shovelled out of the small opening by a worker. An account from Waratah in 1902 describes the final part of the process: “All the fuel had been completely burnt, and the man each time drew out a shovelful of lime and emptied it onto a bag fixed on a frame beside him. As each bag was filled, he wheeled it away, placing it with a heap in another part of the shed.”","Distance and isolation enforced basic self-sufficiency. While this came about through necessity, it also resulted in economic profit.","The early years saw prisoners clearing native vegetation, planting crops and constructing buildings. The island’s resources were used wherever possible - buildings were constructed from sandstone blocks quarried from the southern flats and bricks moulded from island clay mixes. A lime kiln was constructed to burn coral for cement. Maize and vegetable crops, supplemented with sheep and cattle herds, provided much of the island residents’ food requirements. The most successful island produce included sugar cane and award-winning Ayrshire dairy cattle. Olive oil produced from the island’s olive groves also won prizes in Italy.","As the prison became established, the range of industries was expanded. In the 1870s, trade workshops were erected and many products were sold to the mainland. Warders with trade skills trained prisoners to become saddle makers, tinsmiths, boot makers, tailors, blacksmiths and carpenters.","By 1900 the St Helena Establishment accommodated 330 prisoners and operated as a self-sufficient unit. The prisoners were taught carpentry, boot making, tailoring, tinsmithing, bread making, and butchery. Vegetables thrived in the rich soil. The sugar mill crushed locally grown sugar. The most successful outcomes were the sugar cane, the growing of olives, and the prize-winning Ayrshire dairy herd, introduced in 1892.","Prisoners were taught trades in the island’s workshops, including tailoring, boot-making, bread baking and butchery. The island’s prize dairy herd won many awards at the Brisbane Ekka.","It is the earliest attempt in Queensland at providing prison facilities which were essentially self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient and aimed at providing inmates with the opportunity for self-improvement and rehabilitation.","philosophy of prisoner rehabilitation was changing from the earlier ethos of punishment and isolation. The aim was to provide prisoners with a full day of constructive activity and instruction which would equip them with life skills. In addition, the &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nancial strictures of the colony made it desirable for the prison to be as self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cient as possible. McDonald showed considerable initiative and perseverance in meeting these demands.","Under McDonald’s care the prison was described by newspaper journalists as being of the highest standard with clean, healthy prisoners engaged in constructive enterprises that provided them with excellent opportunities for self improvement. The aim of self-suf&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ciency was re&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ected in the process by which new prison buildings were constructed when they were needed. Plans were prepared by several long-serving prisoners to the requirements of the Superintendent, the government architect not being employed. The materials were obtained on the island when possible.","prisoner, Frank Gale, had complained on the 18 attempted escape – 20 Jan January 1932 that timber he had selected for his work detail had disappeared. A search was made of the ‘old carpenter’s shop’ and ‘&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ve boards cut to shape and suitable for making the &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ooring for the bow end of a boat’ were discovered. The Deputy Superintendent of the Prison identi&lt;U+FFFD&gt;es Runkel and Phillips as being the likely suspects due to them being ‘the only two prisoners […] that have access to carpenter’s tools.’","In November 1911, Craig and McIntyre planned their escape. Coordinating to be in the hospital on the same night, McIntyre had secured the tools required for the escape from the tailor shop.","prisoners were made to learn trades, supporting the island with numerous exports such as bricks, clothes, rope, boots and sugar.","Each prisoner at St Helena was required to work a trade on the island. William Hamilton worked pipe-claying steps and cleaning windows with the Housemaids Gang, Julian Stuart laid a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;oor in the pigsty and George Taylor worked in the tailor’s shop.","or many years different trades were carried out on the island including bootmaking, carpentry, cloth making, baking and blacksmithing.","In 1869, the lime kiln and sugar mill were added. Sugar cane growing and processing kept the prisoners busy until the workshops were well enough established to take over as the main source of work on the Island. These trades included bootmaking, sail-making, tailoring, saddle making, tinsmithing, candle making, book-binding and carpentry. The long termers were occupied in these workshops inside the prison stockade and the trustees engaged in animal husbandry and agriculture.","some half-dozen are building a school house; others in the bake house, wash-house, blacksmith’s shop, and the many et ceteras that go to make up a large establishment depending upon its own re-sources for labor.","The workin the boiling-house is done by prisoners; only two warders being present.","The whole process is educational and reformatory in a high degree, and we are glad to find from the records of the establishment that the great majority of the men discharged from it go into regular employment. Few of them return to St. Helena. Since the formation of the settlement, some 700 prisoners have been discharged. It is no ordinary satisfaction to the country to know that not three per cent. of these men have relapsed into crime. This is highly creditable to the system followed at St. Helena, which at once tends to reform the men, and learn them a useful occupation, at which they find employment as soon as they leave the island.","St. Helena is one of the most suitable establish-ments in the colonies for the reception of prisoners, and their preparation for again becoming useful members of society. At the present time the number of prisoners is below the average; there is work and accomodation for double the number - a good omen in itself, but we are at a loss to conceive why this should be the case while some of the goals of the colony have more prisoners than can be properly accommodated. These men should be drafted to St. Helena, where the opportunities for becoming useful and industrious are greater than in any other prison in the country.","The Home Secretary’s anxiety is for a site offering adequate scope for the carrying on of healthy out-door activities, such as farming, gardening, quarrying, and the like; he is a thorough believer in the open-air treatment of prisoners, and dry stat-istics justify his faith in that treatment as assisting greatly in the reformation of prisoners.","The island was all about making money for the government using free prison labour.","St Helena was good business for the government though, as various pro&lt;U+FB01&gt;table industries were established using the abundant free labour. There were carpenters, bricklayers and masons, quarrymen, shoemakers, saddlers, tinsmiths, and labourers.","Sugar cane was planted and a mill built in 1869; and coral was collected for a limekiln producing cement for construction.","government and penal authorities to harness the labour of prisoners in the interests of economy and control.","St Helena had commenced as a penal establishment in May 1867 and was described as ‘experimental’.53 Some longer term male prisoners were employed on the island in small-scale agriculture and land clearance, but there had always been uncertainty about the type of prisoner to be sent to St Helena, ‘trustworthy’ men or the worst long term cases.","Decisions were made quickly. The dire condition of colonial finances, combined with concerns for maintaining discipline, settled the future of the penal system for the next fifty years. The government hoped that St Helena could become self-sustaining and perhaps profitable. A range of trades and workshops would be introduced, and for this able-bodied men, preferably with skills, were required. By the time of the report on St Helena (1869), the government’s view was that St Helena should become the premier penal establishment for men. Brisbane Gaol would process","he Board of Inquiry (1887) reported that prisoners on St Helena were productively engaged, albeit in a narrow range of agricultural and industrial pursuits","On one occasion, a man employed in the bootshop was so incensed against a warder— this man is still in the service, and is a son of the Superintendent of — Gaol— that he was determined to “do” for him.","hinking that it was his enemy standing near to his working-stand, he turned savagely on him and drove a sharp knife right into the heart of the WRONG MAN","drew out the bloodstained knife and threw it at — who stood near the entrance to the room, saying, “It was you, you - , I wanted.” The warder fell dead","another occasion, the blackfellow ‘“Al-bert,” now under coercion treatment at Boggo-road, tried to get to the same warder — with a tomahawk","two men tried to get away and failed. A gang of men were working in the quarry at the western end of the island, behind the superintendent’s house. War-der Rhodes, in charge, was on the ground. A number of men were on top engaged in cutting out shelves. It was midwinter; rain and mist obscured the atmosphere, and a semi-darkness set in about 4 o’clock in the afternoon. Two young fellows, each serving a three-years term, slipped away from the top unseen by the warder, and hiding in the mangrove swamp, were not missed until, about ten minutes to 5, when the gang mustered for return to the stockade.","younger of the two gaol-breakers was found in the mud, wet and hungry, about 7 o’clock, and created a good deal of amusement, on being returned to the stockade, by demanding, “Where’s MY HOMINY?” The other, a more experienced bushman, was at large until nearly midnight. He got into the water, and remained concealed there, his head hidden by the overhanging branches of a mangrove tree, until he thought he mightly safely venture forth. His plan was to get one of the horses, and by its aid swim the shark-infested channel to the mainland. The plan miscarried, owing to all the horses having been stabled, as soon as the alarm was given. As he approached the stable-door, he found himself look-, ing down the barrel of a rifle steadily poised in the hands of a warder.","the writer never saw a deliberate, studied act of spiteful tyranny on the part of any official who is employed at the establishment.","there is sufficient “oversee-ing” (a warder continually in sight) to limit their corruption to vile conversa-tion, and the almost continual glorifica-tion of law-breaking of every kind, the conditions make it a million to one against any young prisoner coming out of St. Helena with the little good he might have possessed when he entered the establishment.","The rule of the Clever Brigade (which is asserted by acts of tyranny whenever a warder’s eye is off, and verbal torment nearly al-ways) and their instructions constitute a scandal of such atrocity that it could hardly be exaggerated.","The State owes more to Mr. Davis than it will ever realise, and it is fortunate, indeed, to have such an officer; for the problem of maintaining discipline among the largest body of prisoners at any one class of work, and securing in-dustry and obedience with so very little punishment, requires an amount of wis-dom and tact as rare as it is valuable.","Absolutely impartial, scrupulously just — with dignified courtesy even to a blackfellow or an Asiatic — he rules the shop with a minimum of “locking up” and “half rations.’” To other warders he is an example, and to prisoners he is a constant inspiration.","Mr. Penne-father is rich in experience, and is mak-ing the best of the work which the wretched tools provided by the Government will allow.","chief warder, who has grown old in the service, is a strange contrast — with his fatherly discipline and kindly disposition","a lofty stockade, massively built, and beside this appears a sentry-box on stilts, holding in-side a watchful warder, who stands close beside his loaded carbine. A little further on is a heavy iron gate leading into the interior of the prison, with three warders looking through the bars.","chief warder, Mr. Bowden, a de-lightful personage in khaki, brisk and keen-witted, and, like the superintendent, quite free from any overbearing or “little ty-rant” manner.","Rows of quiet men, in the regulation prison suits stamped with the broad arrow, and numbered one, two, three, or four as the case may be, are busily engaged in sewing and cutting leather, controlling machines, &amp;c. Each has something to do, and a warder stands ready to admonish or instruct.","This la what we call a pressing machine,” he says, showing us a little metal stamper; ” it makes an ordinary flap of leather into imitation pigskin. You notice that the leather is placed on a copper plate with a raised surface, then the top jaw comes down, and the leather is covered with tiny holes that make it look just like pigskin with the bristles taken out.”","we start off round the benches, seeing first the novices at work making their own shirts and other garments. Then come the more learned mem-bers of the profession, who are sewing away at some rough tweed, making garments for the pensioners at Dunwich and Goodna, and like happy places. Alongside of these are men who have thoroughly learned their trade, and are employed mak-ing greatcoats of blue venetian cloth for the warders and police.","“Do you notice these long white slips of cloth?” queries the warder. “They are to be made into slippers for use in this room. The tailors take off their heavy boots when be-ginning work of a morning, and put on these slippers.","A wall shute off the meat-curing estab-lishment from the hospital enclosure; on the top of this wall we notice another sentry, armed like the first one with rifle, bayonet, and revolver.","He presses down a rod, and a gap appears in the solid partition in front. Passing through, we examine with some amount of curiosity a kind of triangular roof appearing above the ground. Mr. Bowden lifts off this covering, and we look down into a big underground tank, dome-shaped, 22ft. in depth and 18ft. in diameter.","Everything has a spick and span appearance, and the breeze blows un-checked through the windows and out at the door. We are then shown an enamel-led iron bath set on wheels, used t0 bathe sick prisoners in.","“Come along and see the cells and the prison-yards,” says the chief warder; then wo plunge from the light into semi-dark-ness, into the very heart of the prison.","Joe was on top, shovelling down dirt. The war-der ordered me to wheel in and load up whilst Joe was in action. It did not appeal to me to run the risk of stopping a boulder or any other little thing like that with my head, and I demurred, preferring to wait till the, madman up top was done. Th, warder insisted. I point-blank refused.","I was taken before the superintendent and. ordered to the cells for three days on half rations. That three days, without a book or a word from anyone was just hell. Once to while away the time I dipped the end of my finger in the dry whitewash of the cell-wall, and on the back of the door (painted, brown) drew a caricature of the warder who had got me the three days. I got more for that picture than for any work of art I have perpetrated before or since.","As a general thing, the warders are not men who try to tyrannise over their charges.","A bad prisoner is ten times a greater infliction to his fellows than half a dozen bad “screws.”","In my time there was much corruption among the officials. One man was said to have a farm, for which all the harness required was made in the prison workshops and worked away by the aid of prisoners “in the joke,” who were paid with tobacco.","From my own experience of the uselessness of prison discipline as a reformative, and from my knowledge that the men “in-side the walls” are in the main no different from those on the outside, with the exception that they have been found out, I am not surprised at officials being corrupt","Of course, this statement does not apply to all the officials, or even a majority of them.","on a recent Melbourne Cup a prisoner “bookie” held no less than 700 “figs” in his bag. How did that tobacco get there?","suicide of a trade instructor. There was, it transpires, some connection between the escape and the tragedy in so far as the whisky which the convict Craig had in his possession in the gaol hospital, and gave to two of the inmates who slept while the escape was being executed, was innocently supplied in a spirit of mistaken kindness, by the unfortunate man who afterwards took his own life.","illicit trafficking in articles made by prisoners out of Government stores - trafficking in which the prisoners are assisted by the warders -","obscene conversations carried on with the connivance of, or winked at by, the warders, and the initiation of youthful criminals into deeper degrees of vice by past ministers in the art.","some time ago a certain section of the warders represented to the Home Secretary the internal rottenness of the institu-tion, and petitioned for the removal of those who by their apathy, or worse, con-sented to such a state of things.","and all is said to have been committed with the connivance, or at any rate the tacit sanction of the warders.","is it a fact that a Frenchman whose sentence was nearly completed applied to the Chief Warder for treatment, and was told that he was sham-ming, and ordered to return to duty, which he attempted to do, but fell down in a fit, was locked up in his cell, and died before he could be carried to the hospital after his groans attracted attention, not from the Chief Warder, but from others.","with regard to letters from the convicts to their friends. It is well known that such letters are not permitted to be writ-ten except by the authority OF THE SUPERINTENDENT, and that then such letters are most care-fully censored.

How is it that convicts are con-stantly being tried for writing such letters?","s it a fact that the warders see to the posting of them for a consideration? The actual consideration is openly mentioned -5s. in the pound for money sent by the friends of the prisoners. Warders are openly stated to be “fences.” Of one man in particular it is said that he has been given letters ad-dressed by prisoners to their friends, and that the money SENT IN REPLY he has stuck to, and only disgorged when forced to do so","also that tobacco and other small luxuries sent for the use of the convicts, and which he has been paid to deliver, he has converted to his own use.","the cooks are stated to openly rob the invalids and hospital inmates of the comforts allowed them, and to sell them, producing them if by chance their defalcations are discovered as proof that they are doing good work and saving the Government stores for the Government.","A suite of furniture is said to have been made by the prisoners for the island officials from the Government stores, and A CONCRETE INSTANCE is mentioned of one such case which was nearly discovered owing to the unexpected visit of the Home Secretary, when-the goods were covered with bags of shavings and left in the carpenter’s yard, with the full connivance of the officials implicated.","correspondent pertinently asks how it is if no “crook” work of this sort is carried on, that the prisoners are con- stantly being punished for having tobacco in their possession. Where doesthe tobacco come from? It is an open secret that it comes from the warders, and can they afford to supply it except for a certain quid pro quo?","BOOTS FOR INSTANCE� are made in the shops and disposed of outside.

For a quarter stick of tobacco, the value of which is about twopence, he used to purchase SOCKS WORTH A SHILLING a pair. For braces which cost 2s, 6d. he would give three-quarters of a plug. A warder used to supply him with tobacco. He gave the things which he had bought to the warder after he had removed the brands which are put on them when they arrive at St. Helena. The warder allowed him a commission on all he bought. Our correspondent says he firmly believes that the authorities knew that this most de-spicable form of collusion was being carried on, because he had been assured that a prisoner had reported it.","On one occasion a box was discovered on the trolly, just ready to be popped aboard the steamer. Inquiries were made as to whom it be-longed, and no answer forthcoming, it was confiscated and on being opened was found to contain boots, clothes, saddlery, etc, all gaol products, and all stolen.

The warders wear slippers; their movements can be seen, not heard.","warders are mostly married men; seven have their wives and families on the island. The others are quartered in large roomy barracks.","The pay of these men ranges from �100 to �200 per annum, with rations.","They are a quiet well-conducted body of men.","Each man as he empties his bucket into the hole has to salute the warder, and the idea of a man with a hammock over his shoulder and a night-bucket in his hand saluting a warder is worthy of— well, St. Helena.","As the men go out to work they have to SALUTE THE WARDER at the gate— St. Helena is all salutation.","after washing-up, three-quarters of an hour’s recreation (save the mark) in the yards is allowed. After which, the bell rings for roll-call. The men are ranked up in silence, answer their names, and salute the warder. They are then searched before the superintendent, and must not forget to salute, after which they go to their wards or cells, are locked up, sing out, “Right, sir,” salute again, and have to keep silence until the superintendent goes his round with the chief warder on duty for the “dog watch,” who presently sings out “Right, men,” when talking is allowed for one hour. Then “Silence” is ordered, after which any talking or noise up to the time of the morning bell is punish-able.","Seven days light cells means that a man is kept that number of days IN A SMALL CELL for 23 hours out of the 24, and is only allowed half-rations. He is allowed one hour’s exercise in the probation yard, which is about 25 yards long by six or seven yards wide. Only one man is allowed to exercise at a time, and the warders on probation duty take it week about to look after them.","If a man goes sick he is placed in a small cell on sick ration, that is, about half the full ration. He is allowed no tea, and— greatest deprivation of all— no book. An old warder doses him with oil (the only’ medicine) if he considers he requires a dose. If the patient’s temperature rises above a certain point he is sent to the hospital for treatment, otherwise he may remain in the cells for months.","The meat is taken from the boat to the butchers, weighed, and the best of it is taken for the superintendent, the comp-troller, and the chief warder.

It is put into nets, THROWN INTO A BARROW and wheeled to tho kitchen, where seven convict cooks are employed. There it is generally boiled, and the cooks can take what they want for themselves and their pals, as the warder in charge never sees the meat cooked. When cooked, the warder in charge sees it put on the trollies for the yards.","tainted meat was taken by the prisoners before the doctor, who admitted it was not good, but nothing was done. The trouble seems to lie in the fact that the warder who supervises the kitchen has also charge of the bakery. He is a baker by trade, and it Is easy to see where he would be likely to put in most of his time. In many cases he cannot SATISFACTORILY SUPERVISE both departments.","warders, of whom there are 40 on the island","there are black sheep among them, and the prisoners’ chief complaint against them is that they are too apt to make favorites.","prison warders— men who are responsible for the care, well-being, and safe custody of those who have broken society’s laws.","It is openly said on the island that if a prisoner, perhaps inadver-tently, makes himself objectionable to the warder, he is blackballed and is constantly “brought up.” A case is cited of a prisoner who requested to be transferred to Boggo-road on account of the way he was per-secuted at St. Helena","coveted positions among the prisoners are billets— vanman, buggyman, hospital men, clerks, and so on. These men are allowed to go about practically unwatched, though most of them have to attend the roll-call - some do not even HAVE TO DO THAT. In the making of these appointments, it is said the greatest favoritism is shown, and the men, knowing this, plot, mine, and countermine. “Informing” to curry favor is resorted to, and all sorts of underhand work indulged in.","A striking example of the extent to which favoritism is carried is afforded by the “pet crowd.” These men do simply as they like. They have two good meat meals a day, butter, milk, and so on.","instructors arc supposed to be tradesmen when they are appointed, yet there is the warder-baker instructor, who came to St. Helena in April, 1913, and was appointed a few weeks after on probation. He has since been appointed warder baker at St. Helena. There was a prisoner in the bakehouse as assistant before this instruct-tor came to the island. The prisoner in the bakehouse was told by the superintendent and the Comptroller-General of Prisons that he must teach the new warder how to bake,","the baker instructor— he is better known inside the stockade as “Gentle Annie”","On one occasion the bread was very raw. The superintent, on his round at 10 o’clock the next day, told the warder baker to cook the bread better.","This warder baker is in charge of the kitchen, having under his charge nine prisoners. The way he abuses these men is a disgrace to the establishment. This warder has locked up more men during the 12 months he has been on St. Helena than all the rest of the warders","I have known him to lock a prisoner up and put a charge against him for absolutely nothing. Thanks, however, to the superintendent they were not punished. I can name from memory nearly 30 prisoners this warder has had punished within the space of 12 months.","As the baker warder takes the tucker down the back of the yards, he is reponsible for all prisoners’ food, and in seeing that it is cooked, and that every man gets his allowance. His chief hobby, however, is to see that everything is polished before 10 o’clock in the morning, when the superintendent goes his rounds. All the kitchen utensils are polished outside, but inside they are dirty. Tucker is always cold when it reaches the yards, and unless a man has the constitution of a pig he can not eat the tucker. The rations are issued from the store every morning for the stockade kitchen, but the prisoners do not get their full allowance of tea.","some good warders on St. Helena— men who know how to manage prisoners. Their op-portunities are marred by pimps tell-ing tales, mostly a pack of lies.","A warder, on duty, had his attention attracted by an object floating in the sea several hun-dred yards distant from the shore of the island, in the direction of the boat pas-sage. He immediately reported the mat-ter to his chief, and the prison launch, manned by a number of warders, put out to sea and was soon heading towards the floating object.","As the launch drew closer it was no-ticed that the object was almost sub-merged. On it was the body of a man which was almost under the water. When the launch drew alongside the man was discovered to be Hamilton, the escaped convict. He was still dressed in prison garb and he was secured by the warders and placed on board the launch without any resistance. In fact, he was in too weak a condition, from the exposure and want of food, to resist. The object he was floating on was taken in tow and the party returned to the island, where the floating object was discovered to consist of two long forms, lashed together.","A party of soldiers and warders started in pursuit of the runa-ways, who managed to secrete themselves in a thick scrub. Their pursuers, however, placed themselves in such a manner as to be able to discover any attempt on their part to leave their lurking place to procure food; they were, consequently, captured without re-sistance early on Saturday morning.","The gangs at work in the fields and in the boiling-house were marched to their quarters, and the whole force at the disposal of the Superintendent, Mr. M ‘Donald, was directed to the capture of the runaways","while the bodies of wardens were transferred to the mainland, their children were buried on the island. This was heartbreaking for mothers who were unable to visit their graves on a high-security prison island.","Trade Instructor and mason John Labbett Sanders, who oversaw the whole operation as well as the No. 6 gang of prisoners, requested a pay increase in 1888 due to his hours: “I am out at 5 o’clock in the morning until half past six at night and again visit the lime kiln between 9 and 10 o’clock before retiring. This includes Saturdays and Sundays….I am working over 70 hours a week…”","As the prison became established, the range of industries was expanded. In the 1870s, trade workshops were erected and many products were sold to the mainland. Warders with trade skills trained prisoners to become saddle makers, tinsmiths, boot makers, tailors, blacksmiths and carpenters.","Warders’ accommodation varied in style and placement according to their position in the hierarchy. The superintendent occupied a large home with extensive gardens considered some of the best in Queensland. Further along, smaller cottages were home to the wives and children of some warders, while dormitories housed the remaining warders.","Families were removed from the island in the 1890s, causing dissatisfied warders to live apart from them for up to six weeks at a time. The age of the buildings made them a fire hazard, while their 19 th century design did not accommodate new ideas for prisoner reform.","14th of May 1867, the Governor of Queensland signed a proclamation declaring the island “a place whereat offenders under the order of hard labour may be detained”. St Helena became Queensland’s showpiece prison. John MacDonald was the first Superintendent with a staff of five and a military guard of 12 officers. Opening with 60 prisoners, the number of inmates soon increased to 140, rising to 300 persons by 1869.","once an example of a most successful prison institution, by 1920, problems were arising. The prison was ageing. There was the danger of fire. The buildings were of 19th-century design and did not accommodate new ideas in prison reform. Families of the warders had been moved to the mainland by 1890, which caused dissatisfaction amongst the staff.","complaints raised by the men were of offensive language or manner of the Chief Warder, James Hamilton, towards them; `the total, or partial absence of Sentry Boxes’ for the protection of sentries during inclement weather; and `great complaints concerning an offensive cesspool’ located near one guard post. But it was the actual duties that these soldiers were expected to perform, and the numbers of men from the Military Guard used as sentries at any one time that was also of concern to Captain Eden: … the fact that they are a great deal to arms, and, as I rather think, not sanctioned by the `Queens Regulations’. With respect to this I mentioned my objection to Mr Superintendent Macdonald, stating I could not allow the use of five sentries from a guard of but eleven effective men. My objection appears to have had no use yet with him, for I have ascertained that he regards the military Regulations, as expressed through me, with no attention whatever, and still continues to employ more sentries than the Guard can properly furnish. (145)","St Helena, by the 1900s the penal establishment held over 300 prisoners. Those with privileges were permitted to swim in the sea once week ‘at their own risk’.57 Guards supervised their activities day and night to ensure no one escaped. Stories circulated that sharks were fed deliberately to encourage their presence around the island to prevent escapes.","Shark-proof swimming enclosure St Helena Island housed prisoners and a community of prison wardens. It was during the reign of St Helena Island Penal Establishment’s &lt;U+FB01&gt;fth Superintendent, John Alexander MacDonald, that a shark-proof swimming enclosure and dressing shed for off-duty wardens was constructed alongside the wharf in 1916.","the shark-proof swimming enclosure at St Helena Penal Establishment was made with &lt;U+FB01&gt;xed walls constructed from railway lines driven vertically into the sand with spaces between each pile to allow the &lt;U+FB02&gt;ow of seawater. It was approxi-mately 40 x 20 feet (12.1 x 6.1 metres) in size and was built during a period when a range of recreational facilities were being built on the island for warders, including a cricket pitch and tennis court.","It was used only for the recreational swimming of off-duty prison warders.","While providing a recreational swimming place for warders, the enclosure visually reinforced to prisoners and visitors the administration’s narrative that the waters around St Helena were full of human-eating sharks.","The swimming enclosure was accompanied by a timber dressing shed and, despite the tragic death of a warder who broke his neck diving into the pool at low tide at night in December 1917, it was very popular with off-duty warders.","the alarm raised at St. Helena on Tuesday was caused by two aboriginal convicts rushing from the gang in which they were working, and concealing themselves in a clump of cane. They would not answer to the repeated calls of the warders, so that the “alarm” was given and a search for the fugi— tives commenced. The gangs at work in the fields and in the boiling-house were marched to their quarters, and the whole force at the disposal of the Superintendent, Mr. McDonald, was directed to the capture of the runaways, Watcbes were also set to prevent them escap— ing from the island.","A bakehouse, wash house, kitchen, punishment cells and a convalescent ward for sick prisoners were also built. On the rising ground behind these buildings, a large timber structure housed store rooms, doctors rooms, clerks rooms, quarters for twelve military personnel and one of&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cer, and accommodation for ten warders. Also on rising ground, though separate, was a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ve room cottage for the superintendent in an acre of fenced land.","One of the most successful early enterprises undertaken on the island was the growing and processing of sugar. McDonald trained himself in the processes involved and the mill was considered something of a wonder in its own right. The crushing rollers were horse-driven and hand fed by the prisoners. The syrup was gravity fed into vats for boiling down and crystallisation. The &lt;U+FFFD&gt;nal product was a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ne golden coloured sugar of table quality which was used, not only by other government institutions, but was sold commercially. Both cane and sugar won many awards at the annual International Exhibition. The cane served other useful functions on the island, the trash providing fuel for the warders’ &lt;U+FFFD&gt;res.","To the north of the prison buildings is the Chief Warder’s house and its detached kitchen. The house is a weatherboard building and has been fully repaired and reconstructed. The detached timber kitchen has recently been conserved. Both are roofed with corrugated iron sheeting. There is a timber laundry building near the house. The site of warders’ cottages, the school and church is on the eastern side of the island.","reports from the prison staff that both Max and John had been seen out of bounds within nearby mangroves. As reported by the Deputy Superintendent: ‘I met Temporary Warder Boatman Davies and received his report. He stated that after searching the mangroves for about ten minutes, he saw two men carrying timber along the foreshore, coming in his direction. He too up a position behind a clump of small mangrove bushes and waited. Prisoners Phillips and Runkel passed within 25 feet of his hiding place each carrying a board about 6’ x 2’6”. He did not stop them, intending to locate their destination. He states that he found it very dif&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cult to follow as he had to keep well in the mangroves to avoid being seen. He eventually lost sight of them but followed their tracks until he lost those also …’","Craig had been gifted three-quarters of a cup (six ounces) of whisky from Warder","Craig and McIntyre presented themselves back at the stockade on the morning of 17 November. They had managed to avoid authorities for 11 days without leaving the island. A formal inquiry into the escape was held. Warder Rawlinson expressed guilt over the gifting of the whisky. On 28 November 1911, before the inquiry had concluded and at only 34 years of age, Warder Rawlinson committed suicide by cutting his throat.","In February 1898, warder Henry Harris Dodd was fatally stabbed by prisoner William Archer. Archer held a grudge against a warder, but it wasn’t Dodd. According to Superintendent James Ryan, Archer complained to warder Downie, who restrained him after the stabbing, that he was ‘… the bugger it was intended for’.","life of the island rotated around the supervision of prisoners – as seen in the constant patrols, barred windows and leg irons. This constant regulation of work, behaviour and movement was the essence of 19th Century prison life.","entries were posted, windows barred and warders were constantly on the alert.","twenty-five officers and warders keep the establishment in order. The whole are under the care of Mr. John McDonald, who has superintended St. Helena since its first occupation as a penal settlement.","The island has been stripped of timber; a few trees only of the dense growth that formerly covered it are now standing. They are close to the garden of the Superintendent. A few mangrove bushes still occupy a portion of the low wet land with which the island is surrounded. The high and dry land is covered with cane; and some seven or eight acres of mulberry trees have been planted on steep banks. This total clearing of the island was adopted that there might be no cover for prisoners who attempted to escape.","warders can now see clear over the whole place. But this free exposure is bad for the cane. The winds come in unbroken gusts upon it, and have during the past winter converted fully one-half of the entire crop into a tangled mass of damaged and broken cane. All the varieties - Bourbon, Diard, Chigacca, Salan-gore, and Guigham - have suffered from the winds. The ribbon cane alone has withstood the storms, and promises a fair return in sugar.","The workin the boiling-house is done by prisoners; only two warders being present.","originally grown on St HelenaIsland in MoretonBay for over the past 100 years, it has truly proved itself to be an outstanding performer for our climate. So successful was this original grove planted out by the warden of the prison on the island at the time that the fruit was shipped back to Italy!","as the Home Secretary himself admits, there is greater cost in the maintenance of an island prison because of the cost of transport and loss of time for officials and other travelling-to and from the place, — to say nothing of inconvenience to mar— ried members of the prison staff.","At the tip of the original causeway is a ďswimming poolĒ. Prisoners placed steel tram tracks vertically into the water to make an enclosure for wardens to swim safely away from sharks.","wardens were taken to the mainland, the children were buried on the island","Escapes were rare, any attempt considered “a gratuitous self-in&lt;U+FB02&gt;iction of punishment”. Warders watched every movement from sentry boxes above the four corners of the stockade and even if an escapee did make it out, they had to survive swarms of mosquitoes in the mangroves around the island before tackling the strong currents and shark-infested waters for more than 5km to the mainland.","buildings at St. Helena were con-structed of wood, more or less, decay-ed, in bad condition, and as they be-came older the risk of fire increased.","they had not only broken out but also broken into the gaol enclosure and had secreted themselves in the ceiling of one of the workrooms.","not by any means a modern prison, for instead of being circular and all the passages leading to a common centre, it is oblong, and the different ways con-verge only on the gate.","It is divided into two long rooms, separated by a wooden partition. In the first room is a babel at conflicting sounds. There is the banging of hammers, the zir-r-r of flying machinery, and the click of tools. On the left are bootmakers, and on the right saddlers, brushmakers, and bookbinders.","Besides the trades already mentioned there are two or three others going on in the same room, such as binding brushes, and making horse rugs and tents.","Thirty prisoners are employed in room No. 1, and a score of these find employment in the boot trade.","In the cloth room thirty-one men are hard at work con-verting snowy heaps of material into shirts, trousers, &amp;c.","At the end nearest to us nearly all the men are coloured— Chinese, aboriginals, Kanakas, &amp;c. “We make it a rule to keep all the blacks and Chinamen together, if it is at all possible,” says the tailoring expert, “for the whites do not like being closely associated all day with men of an alien race.”","Once a week each prisoner receives so much work, and he is held directly responsible for its completion within a specified time.","from below—from the tinshop,","The tinshop is long and most of the avail-able space is filled up with tanks, buckets, tins, &amp;c, in and around which four men are dodging with redhot irons, and formidable hammers.","we wan-der through into an adjoining yard, and visit the premises occupied by the blacksmiths and carpenters.","The workshop of the blacksmiths is made of the island stone, quarried by prisoners. Among the many articles turned out by the two smiths are horseshoes, farm imple-ments, police beds, and a sanitary-cart","The carpenters, six in number, have a large and airy building.","In the en-circling yard may be seen a coal shed, and a place for storing up the carpenters’ wood, also a long array of moleskins, blue jumpers, and such like dainty garments, strung out on clothes’ lines.","The kitchen, situated near one corner of the stockade, looks like an immense laundry with the thick clouds of steam rising from the boilers placed at one end, and heated by a big fire.","In one boiler is “hominy,” or maizemeal, thick and white, and very appetising—to those that like it. In another great steam can is meat, and a third holds a plentiful supply of soup for the coming Wednesday.","In my time there was much corruption among the officials. One man was said to have a farm, for which all the harness required was made in the prison workshops and worked away by the aid of prisoners “in the joke,” who were paid with tobacco.","A suite of furniture is said to have been made by the prisoners for the island officials from the Government stores, and A CONCRETE INSTANCE is mentioned of one such case which was nearly discovered owing to the unexpected visit of the Home Secretary, when-the goods were covered with bags of shavings and left in the carpenter’s yard, with the full connivance of the officials implicated.","BOOTS FOR INSTANCE� are made in the shops and disposed of outside. When the warder-in-charge turns his back for a moment the different parts are “shaken,” then put together, and the ‘finished articles concealed, afterwards to be deposited in the scrap bucket until the warder “in the know” has opportunity to remove and sell them. The reward to the prisoners is tobacco or a percentage of the price obtained.","at 6.30, for muster. The roll is called, and squads are formed, each under the care of a warder, for the various works going on. Parties are detailed for duty in the bakery, washhouse, blacksmith shop, carpentery, &amp;c.","The practice is to hoist a signal flag on the Government steamer when there is a clergyman on board desirous of holding service. The men are mustered at once, and such as desire to attend do so. The others return to their work.","Recently a large force of men was engaged making netting for kangaroo traps. This netting is made of strong rope. It is of sufficient height to prevent a kangaroo jumping over it, and the intention is to fasten the netting to trees and stakes in the form of yards, and then drive the kangaroos in the usual way. Some 1000 yards have been made, but the supply of rope has given out, and there is a stoppage in consequence. The intention is to have about three miles of netting, and to move it about and arrange it in places where effective kangaroo drives can be made. This netting is for a kangaroo association in the north.","The 24 hours of the day are apportioned as follows: 8 hours work, 13½ hours in cells or wards, and 2½ hours in the yards.","Work commences about 7 a.m.","All are clad in the one garb— moleskins, cabbage-tree hat, underflannel, and twill cotton over shirt. One change of these clothes is allowed per week, except to men in billets who never get any dirty work to do— they get two changes. Every suit is branded with the wearer’s number and “St. Helena Penal Establishment.” If by chance a man gets his clothes worn or torn, he goes to the store and: gets what is known as a suit of “duck egg”clothes to wear while his own are being washed or repaired. These “duck eggs” are suits which have been condemned. They are all branded with the broad arrow.","As the men go out to work they have to SALUTE THE WARDER at the gate— St. Helena is all salutation.","Buildings were also constructed using local resources where possible. For example, a lime kiln opened there in 1869 to burn coral in order to make cement.","During the 1870s a number of trade workshops were erected, and some prisoners were trained as saddle makers, tinsmiths, boot makers, tailors, blacksmiths and carpenters.","As the prison became established, the range of industries was expanded. In the 1870s, trade workshops were erected and many products were sold to the mainland. Warders with trade skills trained prisoners to become saddle makers, tinsmiths, boot makers, tailors, blacksmiths and carpenters.","By 1900 the St Helena Establishment accommodated 330 prisoners and operated as a self-sufficient unit. The prisoners were taught carpentry, boot making, tailoring, tinsmithing, bread making, and butchery. Vegetables thrived in the rich soil. The sugar mill crushed locally grown sugar. The most successful outcomes were the sugar cane, the growing of olives, and the prize-winning Ayrshire dairy herd, introduced in 1892.","Archival digital scans done in 2016 have recorded for posterity the few restored timber structures and remaining masonry features on the island, including the rusting remains of a shark-proof swimming enclosure built in 1916.","In 1868 a substantial timber barracks to house approximately 130 prisoners was completed, in addition to the buildings and jetty previously constructed for the quarantine station.","A bakehouse, wash house, kitchen, punishment cells and a convalescent ward for sick prisoners were also built. On the rising ground behind these buildings, a large timber structure housed store rooms, doctors rooms, clerks rooms, quarters for twelve military personnel and one of&lt;U+FFFD&gt;cer, and accommodation for ten warders. Also on rising ground, though separate, was a &lt;U+FFFD&gt;ve room cottage for the superintendent in an acre of fenced land.","A boat house of local stone, a coarse conglomerate, was being constructed near the landing area. It was also planned to construct a church and schoolhouse within the stockade.","By the early twentieth century conditions had changed once more under the superintendence of James Ryan and visitors to the island extolled its virtues at length. It was described as the ‘pearl of Moreton Bay’ and ‘the garden of beauty’. Such descriptions aroused public interest and in 1912 a campaign was mounted by the Moreton Bay League for the closure of the prison and the conversion of the island into a place of public recreation. The Government quashed this movement by announcing plans for a new, more substantial prison on St Helena, but this did not proceed and in 1921 it was decided to close the prison and make the island a prison farm. Most of the inmates were removed to Boggo Road Gaol and those who remained were occupied with the demolition of most of the gaol’s infrastructure, including fences, stockade walls, workshops and other buildings.","Near the stores is the former blacksmith shop. It is a simple rectangular building of large stone blocks and has gabled ends. Stone walls remain from a small of&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ce building, a ward building, a bakehouse, gas house lime house and lumber shed. There as small unidenti&lt;U+FFFD&gt;ed structures in the site of C yard and near the bakehouse.","Further towards the shore there is a low &lt;U+FFFD&gt;at area that was used for prison animals. The only substantial remains of the complex of yards and buildings is the former fodder shed. It is a rectangular stone building with gabled ends and an iron roof. Concrete &lt;U+FFFD&gt;oors from the piggeries and several wells can be seen.","To the north of the prison buildings is the Chief Warder’s house and its detached kitchen. The house is a weatherboard building and has been fully repaired and reconstructed. The detached timber kitchen has recently been conserved. Both are roofed with corrugated iron sheeting. There is a timber laundry building near the house. The site of warders’ cottages, the school and church is on the eastern side of the island.","After nightfall on 16 November, Craig and McIntyre left the roof and acquired tools from the workshops to scale one of the prison gates. Once out, they made their way to the boathouse where they attempted to move two boats. They were unsuccessful. After failing to coerce a horse into dragging the smaller boat to shore, they gave up.","The first few years were devoted to construction of the two cell blocks, kitchen, bakehouse, hospital, underground tanks, stables, boathouse, storehouse, jetty and Superintendents home. This formed the base of a building program which continued until the prisons last years.","In 1869, the lime kiln and sugar mill were added. Sugar cane growing and processing kept the prisoners busy until the workshops were well enough established to take over as the main source of work on the Island. These trades included bootmaking, sail-making, tailoring, saddle making, tinsmithing, candle making, book-binding and carpentry. The long termers were occupied in these workshops inside the prison stockade and the trustees engaged in animal husbandry and agriculture.","Some of the buildings were made from beachrock quarried on the island, or from bricks made on site from clay found at the northern end of the island. Others were constructed of timber imported from the mainland.","the prison layout and organisation was based essentially on the English penal system, the prison architecture was largely a reflection of the late 19th Century trend to a colonial style of architecture.","some half-dozen are building a school house; others in the bake house, wash-house, blacksmith’s shop, and the many et ceteras that go to make up a large establishment depending upon its own re-sources for labor.","Plans have been prepared for the erection of new prison buildings","new prison buildings would be of brick and concrete, to make them more resistant to fire than the pre-sent wooden buildings. The isolation would be higher and better, being open to the prevailing breeze, so that there would be ample ventilation. The prison would be on the most modem and up-to-date lines. Single cells would replace the associated cells, and provision would be made for lighting the quarters of the prisoners who secured privileges by good conduct.","The largest male prison was on the island of St Helena where the dormitory buildings were falling apart and constituted a fire hazard.","government and penal authorities to harness the labour of prisoners in the interests of economy and control."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>document<\/th>\n      <th>tag<\/th>\n      <th>content<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":1522,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":1},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"orderCellsTop":true,"lengthMenu":[10,25,50,100,1522]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
