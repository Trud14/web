PRISON LABOR.

If one is to believe all one hears, the chief penal establishment of the State at St. Helena is viewed by the
class who fre-quent it as a somewhat idealistic habitat in times of stress. They gradually come to look
upon it as "home," and when the time arrives for a compulsory severance of home ties, the most hardened
inhabitants accept the parting stoically, but with a solemn conviction that they are only saying au revoir
and not good-bye. The present conditions of existence on the island are to be shortly improved by the
introduction of chairs, tables, literature and electric light into the cells of the good conduct prisoners. All
of this is in consonance with the modern system of regeneration, or reformation in the treatment of
criminals, but there are some people who hold the view that the same object could be attained, and with
more benefit to the State and the commu-nity, by the utilisation of prison labor on work outside the gaols.
For instance, it has been suggested that prison labor from St. Helen-a could be used for the reclama tion
and improvement of some of the islands of Moreton Bay, in brushing the under-growth, forming
approaches, erecting ac-commodation sheds, etc. The idea, how-ever, meets with no favor in Home
Depart-ment circles, and a request by a Northern local authority to utilise prison labor on tho roads, was
peremptorily refused by the Home Secretary, who forecasted that such a scheme would inspire a great
outcry if

adopted in Queensland, and that even those

who in theory might favor it, would join in

the outcry if it was put into practice. He believes, he says, in treating prisoners in a manner that will
conduce to their reforma-tion, but. has set his face against their em-ployment at work outside the precincts
of the gaols.
