Shearers’ Strike 1891

JOL Admin


For almost four months during 1891, central Queensland was preoccupied with a feud between
shearers striking against working conditions and wealthy squatters.

Recognised as one of Australia’s first major industrial disputes, the strike occurred during the
overseas-induced depression of the 1890s. Economic instability overseas impacted on falling wool
prices in Australia, creating tension between the shearers and the pastoralists who proposed a
reduction to the shearers’ wages, which then stood at £1 per hundred sheep shorn. The shearers
retaliated by refusing to supply their labour – a crippling blow to the wool industry.

In response to the strike, the pastoralists introduced non-unionist 'free labourers' who received the
protection of police and troopers. Unionists staged parades and public protests with many arrested
and jailed.

In February 1891, the centre of the strike shifted to Barcaldine – the terminus of the rail line from
Rockhampton, and at the centre of the Mitchell district, the richest pastoral area of the colony.

Later, the strike committee was arrested at Barcaldine and were later tried for offences such as
conspiracy, rioting and sedition. Thirteen of the union leaders were brought to trial at Rockhampton
and sentenced on 20 May 1891 to three years at the penal establishment, St Helena. They were
admitted to St Helena on 28 May 1891.

Despite the strength of union protest, the strike was unsuccessful. Many historians believe that the
Shearers’ Strike 1891 hastened the call for a political movement to represent the interests of working
people, which later led to the formation of the Labor party.

Records at Queensland State Archives tell the story of these events, particularly through government
correspondence, court and prison records such as:
