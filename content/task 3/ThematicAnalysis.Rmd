#### [***The Analysis***]{.underline}

This thematic analysis focussed on the history of the St Helena Penal Establishment located in Moreton Bay, Queensland. The sources gathered, once analysed, provide themes that reveal areas for further study. The data can be added to existing data to create an easily found and accessible (not behind a paywall), dataset, that is open access (not one program specific) and reproducible - a FAIR dataset.
