Townley, reduced the acreage on the island to provide only for the prison’s needs. This crop was subsequently reduced even further, until in 1890 the prison commenced purchasing sugar from external sources. The sugar mill was converted into a laundry and a herd of dairy cattle was introduced to provide milk, butter and cheese for the prison."
653,Queensland Government_2015_Saint Helena Island.pdf,closing and moving to mainland,"Townley enforced a more rigid discipline than McDonald and the harsh conditions on the island soon earned St Helena the nicknames of the ‘hell-hole of the Paci<U+FFFD>c’ and ‘Queensland’s Inferno’, although the press described it as a model prison."

It was described as the ‘pearl of Moreton Bay’ and ‘the garden of beauty’. Such descriptions aroused public interest and in 1912 a campaign was mounted by the Moreton Bay League for the closure of the prison and the conversion of the island into a place of public recreation. The Government quashed this movement by announcing plans for a new, more substantial prison on St Helena, but this did not proceed and in 1921 it was decided to close the prison and make the island a prison farm. Most of the inmates were removed to Boggo Road Gaol and those who remained were occupied with the demolition of most of the gaol’s infrastructure, including fences, stockade walls, workshops and other buildings."

727,Taylor_2010_Prisons without walls.pdf.txt,closing and moving to mainland,"The First World War put a temporary halt to many public projects across the country, including prison reform. In 1921, however, the prison on the island of St Helena, off the coast of southern Queensland was converted to a prison farm.49 Officials at the time saw change on the island as part of the wave of reform from the south. There had been a large prison on the island since the 1860s, and as part of the conversion, the inmates were put to work dismantling the old cellblock buildings."
730,Taylor_2010_Prisons without walls.pdf.txt,closing and moving to mainland,"prison farm did not last long: it was closed in 1933, following significant public pressure for its removal, so that the island might be re-made into a beauty spot for boaters and picnickers."

A range of trades and workshops would be introduced, and for this able-bodied men, preferably with skills, were required. By the time of the report on St Helena (1869), the government’s view was that St Helena should become the premier penal establishment for men. Brisbane Gaol would process"

One morning the prisoners complained to the chief war-der that flour was mixed with their oatmeal. The chief warder immediately sent for the chief cook prisoner and told him he had mixed flour with the prisoners’ oatmeal. Of course the prisoner denied it, and told the chief warder that he would prove that the oatmeal was not adulter-ated, by showing some raw oatmeal which was in the kitchen. “All right,” said the chief warder, “and then I will believe you.” The prisoner then proceeded to the kitchen and shortly afterwards returned with a bag half full of oatmeal. “Give it to me,” said the chief warder, and, continuing, “now I am certain that you mixed flour with the oatmeal, because you should not have any oatmeal before the rations are issued for the day.

Various resistance activities were subsequently organised, probably by Eulope, culminating in the Battle of ‘Narawai (near Moongalba) in around 1830 in which a dozen or so British soldiers and convicts were lured into swamps to fight Eulope’s warriors.

532,Harvey_2013_An Overview of Historical Archaeology,interesting,"When the time comes for a review of the Queensland Heritage Act, what constitutes “best practice” in historical archaeology today must of course be the ultimate goal though it must be acknowledged that some compromises will likely be made. For example, several amendments made to the Queensland Heritage Act in recent times have not resulted in improvements to archaeological practice and even weakened the situation. The requirement for practitioners to seek government approval for historical archaeological survey and excavation was removed in 2008. Ever since then potentially destructive work has been carried out with limited regulatory supervision. On the other hand, some temporary protection was added for previously unrecorded archaeological sites located during the course of development or other ground disturbing works. This requirement, however, is fundamentally flawed and relies on those with the least to gain from compliance with the legislation (i.e. a developer or someone hunting historic artifacts for profit such as a bottle collector) to admit they have found or even destroyed important archaeological evidence. Recent changes to legislative requirements in other Australian jurisdictions, such as in New South Wales, have arguably weakened the ability to protect important places and this should act as a warning. Legislation has been and will continue to be developed in reference to political motivations that do not necessarily correlate with the wishes and desires of the archaeological community."

Since 2003, an average of seven places with historical archaeological values has been added to the Queensland heritage register each year, averaging about 17 % of annual registrations. This is close to double the average number added in the preceding decade. The main reason behind the increase is the addition of a specific archaeological place category to the register in 2008. Since then 14 places have been entered specifically for their historical archaeological values.

With the `project of making St Helena a Quarantine Station being abandoned’ these buildings were converted `into convict buildings’ so as `to meet the demand for extra prison accommodation’ when it was decided to instead use the St Helena for that purpose. (134) This report also included details on the proposed accommodation on the eastern side of the island of the Military Guard who were shortly expected to commence duties: The prisoners are now engaged on these works and one of the buildings, that on the West Side of the bluff, will be ready for the reception of about 60 prisoners in the course of a week … but as it is the intention of the Government to put a military guard over the prisoners on St Helena, and no shelter being as yet available, the prison wards cannot be used until the building on the East bank has been temporarily fitted up for the reception of the guard, and this cannot be finished for some three or four weeks to come, as the roof is not yet on the building, and the work being done by prisoners, a longer time is required than if it were being done by free men.

The Non-Commissioned Officer will be responsible for the conduct of the men, under his charge. 2. He will see that all Standing Orders and other Instructions which may be issued from time to time, are strictly and promptly executed, and shall duly report any neglect of the same. 3. It is not desirous to lay down any precise course of conduct for the Non-Commissioned Officer, or to say how much of his time should be occupied in the actual performance of his duties, but he will at all times co-operate with the Superintendent and render every assistance in his power for the maintenance of good order and the general security of the prisoners. 4. He will feel the importance of making occasional visits to the Sentries, seeing that they are on the alert and attending to their duty. 5. He will inspect every sentry before turning him out on duty, see that he is perfectly sober, clean, correctly dressed, armed and accoutred that his rifle is loaded and capped, and that he is supplied with ten rounds of ammunition and a proportionate number of caps, all of which must be in good condition. He will then march them to their respective posts, and see that the Sentries on numbers One, Two and Three posts do duty with fixed bayonets. He will attend at every muster of the prisoners with the proper number of Sentries requited for duty. Station them at their respective posts, and see that each Sentry fully understand the instructions relating to his post. He will see that the Sentry for number `Three’ post is on duty at the time the prisoners are released from their Cells in the morning, and that he does not leave it until after the hoisting of the `All right’ signal at night. He will understand that `Night Duty’ is from the time the prisoners are locked up in the evening until they are released in the morning and will post his Sentries accordingly. Day Posts No.1. is in front of the Prison Buildings No.2. is at the south-east corner of the Yard to command a view of the south and east angles.

550,Hopkins-Weise_Pratt_2001_The scarlet legacy.pdf.tx,Military,"Privates of the 50th who would serve as part of the Military Guard were also provided with lengthy and detailed `General Instructions’ for their guidance. (138) The formalisation of procedures and instructions for both NCOs and Privates serving in the Military Guard appear to have been at least partially instituted following complaints by Superintendent John McDonald about the manner these Soldiers were carrying out their tasks to the perceived detriment of operations of the Penal Establishment. On 31 October 1867, McDonald outlined to the Colonial Secretary: I have … [found] fault on several occasions with the manner in which some of the military guard performed their Duties … and more especially when on the points of landing. That orders on that post, or part of the orders is not to allow any person to land without the written order of the Colonial Secretary or Visiting Justice. But some of the military do not pay the slightest attention to the above order and their attention has been especially called to the part of their orders by the NCO in charge of the guard. On several occasions persons have been allowed to land from the steamer `Kate’ without the sentries demanding their authority and allowed to pass to the prison, the consequence is that anything might be passed to the prisoners at work all over the island. It is necessary that the above order should be strictly carried out; there is another matter I should bring before your notice, viz, of sending Lance Corporals in charge of the guard who do not appear to have the least control over their men which is not the case with a full Sergeant or full Corporal. I think if the matter was brought before the notice of the Capt. Commanding the troops, that he would cause the duties to be more satisfactorily performed in future. (139) Shortly after McDonald again followed up his concerns with another complaint about the behaviour of the Guard in December 1867: I had to complain to the visiting justice of the careless manner in which the military guard perform their duties. [This?] month I found soldiers while on guard talking with prisoners, and on one occasion I found one of them sitting down reading a book while on prison guard, there seems to be a great lack of discipline amongst the guard, as a rule, I have reason to believe that the guard conveys letters to and from prisoners on the island, and the prisoners are kept as well informed of all passing events as if they were in Brisbane Gaol! While such conduct amongst the guard which I have to depend so much upon, is allowed to be carried on, what confidence can be placed in them, there are some of the men trustworthy but, very few of them can be trusted out of sight with prisoners, I have on several occasions reported the men to the NCO in charge who very often is a L/Corporal who has little or no control over their men, if there is not soon a change for the better in the conduct of the military guard it will be quite impossible for me to carry out that order and discipline that should be carried out on the island. (140)"
551,Hopkins-Weise_Pratt_2001_The scarlet legacy.pdf.tx,Military,"Correspondence in January 1868 indicates that Superintendent McDonald made a specific charge of `negligence of duty’ against a Private Poynter, one of the Military Guard who had just been released from duty on St Helena."
552,Hopkins-Weise_Pratt_2001_The scarlet legacy.pdf.tx,Military,"1 February 1868, Superintendent McDonald reported to the Colonial Secretary that the `large prison building’ under construction was expected to be completed by the end of March. Once this building was ready this would allow for the accommodation for 150 prisoners on St Helena. McDonald again used this forum of his regular report as an opportunity to again complain about the Military Guard, suggesting in the process, Warders be used to replace them: If the prisoners are increased to the above number the number of warders will also have to increase, there ought to be one warder for every ten … prisoners together with the military guard as at present established on the island. I would recommend that three warders be substituted for the military guard. The guard is of no service in charge of prisoners at work as they do not take the slightest interest, and pay little or no attention the orders I give them; and as a rule they make free with the prisoners, so that it is impossible to carry out the same discipline that could be carried out with warders. (142)"
553,Hopkins-Weise_Pratt_2001_The scarlet legacy.pdf.tx,Military,"soldiers of the Military Guard were for all intents and purposes, as isolated on St Helena as the prisoners they were expected to guard. Being selected to make up the personnel for mounting this Military Guard no doubt was highly unpopular within the ranks of Brisbane’s 50th garrison. Those men selected had to contend with not only the isolation but also the strict regime of the prison administration and operation. When combined with general dissatisfaction at their placement, some of these soldiers quite naturally adversely reacted to their surrounds and duties — earning in the process the ire of Superintendent McDonald. The soldiers who made up this small Military Guard also quickly found that life on St Helena was a far cry from the facilities, opportunities and pleasures garrison life in Brisbane offered."
554,Hopkins-Weise_Pratt_2001_The scarlet legacy.pdf.tx,Military,"For those soldiers who were tasked with service on St Helena — they too had complaints of their own regarding the conditions of their accommodation and the rations they were expected to tolerate. On 3 March 1868, Lieutenant MacGregor, 50th Regiment, temporarily `Commanding Troops’, wrote to the Queensland Colonial Secretary about certain grievances of the men who had served in the Military Guard detachment: I have the honour to bring to your notice the aged and dirty state of the beds provided for the military guard at St. Helena, and beg to request that you will cause the proper authorities to provide new ones at once. There being no change of beds, or bedcovers, nor means of [?] them I am unable to cast any blame on the soldiers of the guard. I have also to request your attention to the inferior quality of the tea ration which is far below that required by the ordinary Commissariat contract. (143)"
555,Hopkins-Weise_Pratt_2001_The scarlet legacy.pdf.tx,Military,"On 17 June 1868, Captain Eden, the officer now commanding the 50th Regiment detachment in Brisbane, in a detailed correspondence, also brought a variety of complaints of the men of the Military Guard before the Colonial Secretary. With a view to its receiving your early attention I … bring to your notice that the Detachment 50th Regt, last returned from St. Helena … on the 8th Inst. complain in a body of the inferior quality of the rations issued to them at that station. I understand them to say among other things that for the space of their days they had no Bread whatever, and that no potatoes were issued to them for, I think, a period of eight days. I am informed that in the first case a certain quantity of some description of flour was presented to them, in place of Bread with a suggestion that they could make their own … The scale for the Issue of Rations to the Troops at St Helena, if I remember right, was authorized by yourself, and provides for a daily portion of bread and potatoes for the soldiers. I also … bring to your notice a pretty general complaint from the soldiers (and noncomd. Officers in charge) that have of late been stationed at St Helena regarding Mr. Turnkey Hamilton, who, by the way, I understand to be the Issuer above alluded to — his manner to them they designate as most irritating and annoying … I can quite believe this complaint to be exaggerated by irritation, still, judging from the well known character of many of my informants, I am convinced that it contains sufficient grounds to warrant … the attention you may find it to deserve. (144)"
556,Hopkins-Weise_Pratt_2001_The scarlet legacy.pdf.tx,Military,"complaints raised by the men were of offensive language or manner of the Chief Warder, James Hamilton, towards them; `the total, or partial absence of Sentry Boxes’ for the protection of sentries during inclement weather; and `great complaints concerning an offensive cesspool’ located near one guard post. But it was the actual duties that these soldiers were expected to perform, and the numbers of men from the Military Guard used as sentries at any one time that was also of concern to Captain Eden: … the fact that they are a great deal to arms, and, as I rather think, not sanctioned by the `Queens Regulations’. With respect to this I mentioned my objection to Mr Superintendent Macdonald, stating I could not allow the use of five sentries from a guard of but eleven effective men. My objection appears to have had no use yet with him, for I have ascertained that he regards the military Regulations, as expressed through me, with no attention whatever, and still continues to employ more sentries than the Guard can properly furnish. (145)"
557,Hopkins-Weise_Pratt_2001_The scarlet legacy.pdf.tx,Military,"another aspect to the role of the Military Guard on St Helena was the unenviable position in which soldiers might at any time find themselves called upon the fire on prisoners. Such a situation was a glaring potential conflict between Army and civil jurisdiction, as it was liability in case of death or injury that might be inflicted by a soldier. Such a situation was a glaring potential conflict between military and civil jurisdiction since whatever action a soldier took in performing his duty which may have resulted in the death or injury of a prisoner did not exempt him from prosecution under either codes of law. In June 1868, Captain Eden requested through Visiting Justice Barron, that the `instructions for the guidance of the Military Guard’ be amended by the Government so as to provide more detail than those already in use on St Helena. After receiving the Government’s response, Captain Eden replied on 16 June: I believe it to be necessary, before these instructions can be put in force, that some addition to them should be made, that shall regard the necessity for using the loaded Rifles put into the soldiers hands, and explicitly set down when, and from whom an order to fire on a `prisoner’ shall be considered valid, and an exemption from any ulterior consequences that might arise out of such as act, the result of which was the wounding or death of a Prisoner. I am convinced that some rule providing for an emergency of this sort should be laid down and thus tend towards the greater efficiency of the St Helena Detachment. Rule No.11, of `General Instructions’ only forbids the discharge of a Rifle without the Superintendents sanction with a view to prevent any false alarm, and, consequently, denies the Soldier that means of giving warning when a real alarm is necessary, which, it is to be presumed, may occur [soon?] at St. Helena.

He ‘simply stripped a sheet of bark, sewed both ends, and paddled back to Stradbroke’ (Meston 1903, 8) where he was able to keep his identity hidden for a time. Various resistance activities were subsequently organised, probably by Eulope, culminating in the Battle of ‘Narawai (near Moongalba) in around 1830 in which a dozen or so British soldiers and convicts were lured into swamps to fight Eulope’s warriors. Eventually, the British conceded defeat and called a truce."

When combined with general dissatisfaction at their placement, some of these soldiers quite naturally adversely reacted to their surrounds and duties — earning in the process the ire of Superintendent McDonald.

But it was the actual duties that these soldiers were expected to perform, and the numbers of men from the Military Guard used as sentries at any one time that was also of concern to Captain Eden: … the fact that they are a great deal to arms, and, as I rather think, not sanctioned by the `Queens Regulations’. With respect to this I mentioned my objection to Mr Superintendent Macdonald, stating I could not allow the use of five sentries from a guard of but eleven effective men. My objection appears to have had no use yet with him, for I have ascertained that he regards the military Regulations, as expressed through me, with no attention whatever, and still continues to employ more sentries than the Guard can properly furnish.
