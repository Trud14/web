Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser – 5 August 1873

It appears that the alarm raised at St.

Helena on Tuesday was caused by two abori-

ginal convicts rushing from the gang in which

they were working, and concealing themselves

in a clump of cane. They would not answer

to the repeated calls of the warders, so that the

"alarm" was given and a search for the fugi-

tives commenced. The gangs at work in the

fields and in the boiling-house were marched

to their quarters, and the whole force at the

disposal of the Superintendent, Mr. McDonald,

was directed to the capture of the runaways,

Watcbes were also set to prevent them escap-

ing from the island. Up to last night, how-

ever, no intelligence had been received at the

Brisbane Police-office of the capture of the

escapees. The men are named Sandy and

Johnny respectively, the former undergoing a

life sentence for a criminal assault on a woman

on the Gympie road to Maryborough, and the

latter a sentence of seven years' penal servitude

for abetting in the crime. It has transpired

that on Monday night the two aboriginals in-

formed another prisoner of their intention to

bolt, stating that they intended to hide in the

cane until night, and then swim from the

island to the main land. It is not unlikely

they have succeeded in their design, unless the

sharks have interfered to prevent it being

carried to a successful issue. — Courier.
