LOCAL AND GENERAL NEWS.

On Friday morning last, three prisoners named
Irwin, Dawson, and Morris, made their escape from
the penal establishment of St. Helena, with the appar-
ent intention of getting away from the island. A party
of soldiers and warders started in pursuit of the runa-
ways, who managed to secrete themselves in a thick
scrub. Their pursuers, however, placed themselves in
such a manner as to be able to discover any attempt
on their part to leave their lurking place to procure
food; they were, consequently, captured without re-
sistance early on Saturday morning. In their posses-
sion was found two washing g tubs and a washing board,
imperfectly fastened together with rope; it was their
intention to endeavour to reach another island by
means of this frail craft. The Police Magistrate, Mr.
Massie, and the Water Police Magistrate, Mr. Thorn-
ton, held an investigation on Monday last concerning
the escape of the prisoners, and sentenced them to be
flogged. Irwin, who appears to have been the ring-
leader, received thirty lashes, and Dawson and Morris
twenty-five lashes each. The magistrates had occo-
sion to sentence another prisoner named Hanlon to
the infliction of twenty-four lashes for behaving in a
very insubordinate manner. It may not be out of
place here to mention that the danger of attempted
escape of prisoners from St. Helena is increased by the
number and ferocity of the sharks which infest the
Bay.-Guardian.
