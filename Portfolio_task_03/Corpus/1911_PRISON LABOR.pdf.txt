       quent            it   as        a     somewhat                 idealistic                habitat         in
                                                                                                                to

        look        upon
                            it    as  "home," and    when                                                      the
        time        arrives    for a compulsory  severance                                                          of
       home             ties,           the         most           hardened                  inhabitants

       accept                the           parting             stoically,                 but     with                  a


        solemn               conviction                  that    thoy are only saying
        au        nsvolr            and            not        good-bye. The   present
        conditions                  of       existence                on        the       island        are         to

        be      shortly                improved                 by the               introduction                   of
        chairs,              tabfes,               literature               and           electric        light
        into the                 good conduct
                              cells of the     prisoners.
        All of this is in cousonancc    with the modern
        system               of        regeneration,                       or        reformation                    in
        the        treatment                       of        criminals,               but        there         are

        some            people who                           bold          the        view        that         tho
       same             object could                          be      attained,                 and       with

        more            benefit              to     the         State           and        the        commu

       has  been  suggested that prison labor from
       St. Helen a could  be used  for the reclama
