                              For 65 years, St Helena was the scene of some brutal business, but these
                              days it’s a historic national park (Queensland’s <U+FFFD>rst when it was declared
                              in October 1979) that provides excellent motivation to take a trip into
                              Moreton Bay.

                              St Helena is a pleasant 30-minute cruise from Manly on the Cat o’ Nine

<U+F104>                             Tails tour which is the best way to see the island.
                                                                                                                                                                                       <U+F105>
                              This is because access to most of the prison ruins is by guided tour only,
                              and also, this team brings its history to life, led by suitably attired
                              “prisoners” and their guard Andre.

                              The island was never used for convicts but opened in 1867 as
                              Queensland’s <U+FFFD>rst penal establishment to house long-term, high-security
                              male prisoners. Until then, they were crowded into cells at Petrie Terrace
                              and spilling into the hulk Proserpine moored in the Brisbane River.

                              Captain Cook planned to name the bay after Lord Morton who had
                              funded his trip, but inadvertently added an “E”. This was copied by
                              Matthew Flinders three decades later, and it stuck.

                              Flinders, the story goes, imaginatively named the <U+FFFD>rst verdant Moreton
                              Bay island he saw Green Island. He then proceeded to name the others
                              in the group Green Island 2 and Green Island 3 (King Island).

                              Green Island 2, was renamed St Helena in 1827. And that is a story in
                              itself.

                              Eulope, the Turrwan or chieftain of the Nunakal clan of the Quandamooka
                              (Moreton Bay) people, had fought against the military when they arrived
                              at his homeland at Amity Point on North Stradbroke.

                              Of similar stature to the French emperor Napoleon Bonparte, he became
                              known among the British as Napoleon.

                              In 1827, Napoleon “borrowed” a steel axe in Dunwich and was exiled to
                              Noogoon (“place of the <U+FFFD>ying fox” as it was called by the Quandamooka
                              people, or Green Island 2) for his crime.

                              It took him only three days to build a canoe and escape, but it was long
                              enough for the island to be called after St Helena, the island of
                              Napoleon’s imprisonment in the South Atlantic.

                              (Waterloo Bay, Wellington Point and King Island were named at the
                              same time).                                                                                                                                     <U+F106>
                                                                                                                                                                              TO TOP

    In 1866, a quarantine station was built on St

    Helena, but within a year, it was realised it would
    be much better to solve the problem of what to
    do with all the prisoners.

    On arrival at the island, the catamaran docks at a
    jetty built in 1988 to connect to a stone causeway
    built across the mud<U+FFFD>at by prison labourers in the
    island’s prison heyday.

    At the tip of the original causeway is a “swimming
    pool”. Prisoners placed steel tram tracks
    vertically into the water to make an enclosure for
    wardens to swim safely away from sharks.

    Tram tracks? Yes, St Helena had Queensland’s
    <U+FFFD>rst tram. It carried produce and people from the
    stockade and workshops at the top of the island
    to the causeway for export to Brisbane.

    The tram was <U+FFFD>rst hauled by prisoners and later
    by horse.


           The island was all about
           making money for the
           government using free
           prison labour. The irony
           was they produced
           Queensland Police
           uniforms at one stage.

    Sugar cane was planted and a mill built in 1869.
    It wasn’t entirely successful as it was thought
    escapees could easily hide in the cane.

    Remnants of the sugar mill, like the lime kiln used
<U+F104>   to turn coral collected from the bay into a useful                                                                               <U+F105>
    cement for building, can be seen within easy walk
    of the causeway.

    The island has two cemeteries – one for the
    children of the wardens and one for prisoners
    who even in death had numbers not names. It
    was said they would forever remain prisoners of
    St Helena. It is believed about 56 prisoners are
    buried here.

    Many children were born and educated on St
    Helena and while the wardens were taken to the
    mainland, the children were buried on the island.

    This was heartbreaking for mothers who were
    unable to visit their graves on a high-security
    prison island.




    Crew of the aptly-named Cat o’ Nine Tails tour reenact a
    <U+FFFD>ogging.

    Prisoners were forbidden to speak and <U+FFFD>ogged
    until skin became bone. The maximum was 50
    lashes, but this usually had to be done in two
    sessions as 25 was enough to end at the
    in<U+FFFD>rmary. Floggings were always on a Tuesday
    when a surgeon came to the island.

    But even this was preferable to solitary                                                                                <U+F106>

             below ground in a metre-
             wide cell with only a dirt
             <U+FFFD>oor to sleep on, and that
             turned to mud when it
             rained. The prison closed
             in 1932 when, during the
             great Depression, it
             simply became unviable
             to keep it open.

             Production had dropped
             away during World War I
             when prisoners had to
             return to the mainland to
             cover for young men
             shipped off to the
             European battle<U+FFFD>elds.

             By now, Boggo Road,
             which had been used as
             HM Prison for Women,
             was taking men.

             All up, 7500 hardy souls
             experienced the hell of St
             Helena.

             There were some grand
             plans for its future,
             including a golf course
             and rabbit hunting, but in
             the end, it was leased as a
             cattle farm, and was a
             dairy in the 1950s.


<U+F104>            And <U+FFFD>nally, in 1979, St
             Helena was declared                                                                                                <U+F105>
