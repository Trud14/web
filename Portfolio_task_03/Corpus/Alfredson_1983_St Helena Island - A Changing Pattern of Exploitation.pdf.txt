ST HELENA ISLAND - A CHANGING PATTERN OF EXPLOITATION?




Gillian Alf redson




     Discussion about the Aboriginal use of offshore islands (Sullivan
1982a, 1982b) has prompted this preliminary report on St Helena Island,
Moreton Bay, Queensland, which has evidence of over 2000 years of Aboriginal
exploitation. A midden on this island exhibits the high density of bone
typical of middens on New South Wales offshore islands, but in this case
it is a large migratory fruit bat (Pteropus poliocephalus) rather than bird
that is specifically exploited. Initial analysis of a small test excavation
has revealed a change in the midden composition which would appear to
indicate a change in the pattern of exploitation. Independent evidence
appears to exist for a build-up of the mudflats between the mainland and the
island, and the resultant increase in littoral resources, together with
easier access to the island, is offered as an explanation for the variation
in the midden composition.

BACKGROUND

     St Helena is located in Moreton Bay approximately 6 km from the mouth
of the Brisbane River (Fig.l). It consists of a Tertiary basalt core with
a maximum elevation of 21 m at the southeastern corner. This core is flanked
on its western and southern sides by beach ridges of two broad ages of
accretion. The inner east-west trending ridges of red sand which form a
platform of slightly over 4 m in elevation have been considered Pleistocene
in origin; whereas the more coastal ridges are considered to be Holocene
developments (Jones et at. 1978) . Beachrock occurs for about 500 m along
the southwestern margin of the island and overlaps the inner platform. The
island covers an area of approximately 92 ha above high water mark. Mudflats
form a wide supra- and inter- tidal fringe extending nearly 1 km from the
southeast end.
     Since 1867, when the island became a penal settlement, its topography
has been extensively modified by clearing, draining, filling, quarrying and
ploughing. The original vegetation of the island was mainly subtropical
rainforest. Flinders (in Steele 1972:21), Cunningham (in Steele 1975:10)
and Rawnsley (1865) made reference to the dense vegetation on the island
prior to European settlement. Surveyor Rawnsley also observed native wells
and a 'natural paddock1 towards the southwest corner, which, he speculated,
may have once been a lagoon.
     Following the closure of the prison in 1932, the island has been leased
for grazing and recreational purposes. In September 1980 it was declared a

National Park except for 13 ha at the northern extremity which were set
aside for broadcasting purposes. In December that year Morwood (n.d.)
identified and recorded two Aboriginal sites - a midden (LB:C52) and a
'stone working midden1 (LB:C53) on the southern end of the island (Fig. 2).
     Historical references to the Aboriginal use of St Helena Island mention
the exploitation of 'flying fox1 (fruit bat). Fairholme (1856:312) writes:
        On the coast of Moreton Bay the natives live principally on
        fish, and the arrival of the flying foxes on the little island
        of St. Helena is hailed by them as a change of diet. The
        flights occur only in the warmer months of the year...
Petrie (1975:89) also remembers:

        St. Helena was a great camping place for them [flying fox]
        in those days, and the blacks from Wynnum used to go across
        in their canoes to catch them there, watching for calm weather
        both to go and return.

     In order to contribute further information towards the management plan
for the island, I undertook a survey and a small excavation.

THE SITES

     Several ungrassed depressions in the east-west trending ridges have
deflated scatters of stone artefacts and shell. The largest of these
(LB:C53) has an artefact density of up to 15 per m2. The artefacts consist
of flakes, cores and broken grindstones, many of which exhibit cortex.
There is a wide variety of raw material presented - silcrete, quartzite,
chert, mudstone and quartz. A bed of cobbles and pebbles lying off the
southern shoreline is an obvious source of raw material, which is verified
by the many waterworn flakes which can be found in the inter-tidal zone.
     A cross-section of the midden (LB:C52) nearly 50 cm in depth and 30 m
wide has been exposed in the face of the old beachrock quarry used in the
early days of the penal settlement to provide building material. The midden
shells which previously overlaid the beachrock were probably burnt in the
prison lime kiln. Observation in eroded patches and auger ing have established
that the midden extends about 500 m along the beach ridge on which it is
located, but it ha& been increasingly disturbed and scattered by roadworks,
tramway bedding and ploughing north from the intersection of the beach ridge
and the line of the former tramway (Fig. 2). The exposed stratigraphy appears
relatively uniform horizontally, and vertically exhibits varying degrees of
shell density and fragmentation, but no sterile layers. A marked increase
in shell density occurs midway through the deposit. Predominant species of
shell are oyster (Saccostrea commercialis), mussel (Trichomya hirsuta) and
whelk (Pyrazus ebeninus) . These are embedded in a dark grey sandy matrix.
Coral and bone - fragments of the long bone of fruit bat, dugong and fish
vertebrae - are also visible in the section.


EXCAVATION

     In late October 1982, a 50 x 50 cm test pit was excavated adjacent to
the thickest portion of the exposed section. A 10 litre bucket was used as
an excavation unit (Johnson 1980) . Each excavation unit was weighed and
approximately 25% of the material was bagged unsieved for mechanical sieving
in the laboratory. The rest was sieved using a 2 mm mesh and bagged.

ANALYSIS

     Despite the fact that inferences derived from such a small test pit are
extremely limited, and although the analysis of the material is still in
progress, some preliminary observations can be made. The shell density
increases steadily to units 8 to 10 where the shell is about 50% by weight
of the deposit. From units 11 to 16 the shell decreases rapidly from 20%
to 3%.
         The excavated bone is very fragmented. The only large pieces are of
dugong, while over 40% was recovered from the 2 to 4 mm size class. This is
hampering identification; however, fruit bat (Pteropus poliocephalus) and
fish, predominantly of the Sparidae family, are represented throughout the
deposit. The total weight of bone retained by the 2 mm sieve was approxi-
mately 290 gm for 48 cm of deposit analysed. This figure is equivalent to
about 2400 gm per m3 which is the same as the estimated bone density for SQD
of Bowen Island in New South Wales (Blackwell 1980) . The distribution of
the bone throughout the deposit is interesting. The average percentage of
bone in the total material greater than 2 mm from units 2 to 10 is only
about 0.4%, whereas from units 11 to 16 it rises steadily from 1% to 10%.
The mud whelk also shows a definite change in representation throughout the

deposit. In units 11 to 16 it comprises from between 7% and 10% by weight,
while in units 2 to 10 it ranges from 15% to 21% by weight.
     A feature of this midden is the large percentage of coral (mainly
Aaropora spp.) and reef -forming algae (Lithothamnia sp.), over 6% by weight,
distributed fairly evenly throughout the deposit. Although it has been
suggested that this indicates storm wave disturbance (Hughes and Sullivan
1974) , in this case I would suggest it represents incidental gathering with
the shellfish. St Helena is fringed by a coral reef and dead coral reefs
form a base for the attachment of clumps of mussel and oyster. The harves-
ting of small amounts of coral is therefore to be expected. Also, the
presence of small amounts of charcoal and the fruit stones of the blueberry
ash (Elaeocarpus reticulatus) , and a negligible non-economic shell component
(about 1% of the analysed material) would indicate that no reworking has
taken place.

RADIOCARBON DATES

     Two 80 gm samples of Saooostrea oommeroialis were taken from units 9
and 13 for radiocarbon dating. Unit 9, between 18.5 and 21.5 cm in depth,
was the unit with the densest shell; and unit 13, between 33 and 36 cm in
depth, was the deepest unit which contained sufficient whole shell for
radiocarbon dating. The conventional, corrected (Polach et al. 1978) and
calibrated (Klein et al. 1982) values are listed in Table 1.

             Table 1. Radiocarbon dates from LB:C52, St Helena Island


                                         Conventional Corrected Calibrated
               Unit Sample age BP age BP age BP
             EU 9 Beta-6140 1370 ± 60 920 ± 70 870 ± 150
             EU 13 Beta-6141 2240 ± 70 1790 ± 80 1730 ± 210


DISCUSSION

     The uncorrected value of Beta-6141 is close to an uncorrected radio-
carbon date 2540 ± 80 BP (GaK-4770) obtained from shell in beachrock 2 m
above MSL on the eroding southern shoreline (Lovell 1975). This suggests
that St Helena's resources were being exploited during the period when the
seaward margin of the beachrock was still in the process of formation. A
waterworn flake embedded 20 cm from the top of a slumped piece of beachrock
substantiates this.
     The younger date Beta-6140 closely correlates with an uncorrected date
of 1300 ± 90 BP (Beta-3226) also on shell collected from the basal layers
of a midden on a beach ridge at the present shoreline at Cribb Island, a
suburb just north of the mouth of the Brisbane River (B. Ward pers. comm.).
This date documents the minimum age for the beach ridge formation on the
coastal margin of the prograding deltaic plain. It is suggested that this
period of alluvial sediment deposition saw not only the final infilling of
the former delta but also the general shallowing of the bay margin with a
build-up of the mudflats opposite the mouth of the river and around the
island (Hekel et al. 1979). This build-up of mudflats would have greatly
enhanced the island's littoral resources. Although the shallower water
within the island's fringing reef would have always provided good fishing,
an increase in the mudf lat area would have increased the potential shell-
fish habitat, and in turn, the potential availability of this resource.
This appears to be supported by the increase in the shell component of the
midden deposit. More specifically, there is a marked increase in the

proportion of mud whelk (Pyrazus ebeninus) which, as a browsing creeper, is
a better indicator of the presence of mudflats than the filter feeding
mussel and oyster.
     Exploitation patterns are also likely to have been considerably
influenced by the risk involved in the water crossing in the one-piece sewn
bark canoes documented historically (Petrie 1975:97-99). This is relevant
as Moreton Bay is capable of producing wind gusts of up to 35 knots with
accompanying high waves. Through the period of marine transgression the
water crossing from the Wynnum hills to St Helena would always have remained
about 6 km, but the subsequent build-up of the mudflats would have
considerably decreased the risk of the crossing by lessening the distance
at low tides. When the mudflats are exposed, the water crossing between the
mangrove-covered islands at the mouth of the Brisbane River and the mudflats
of St Helena is no more than 2 km, and even less from Green Island if the
island-hopping route from Wellington Point is used. In the lower levels of
the midden (units 11 to 16) there is a much higher proportion of fish and bat
bone compared with the shell component. This agrees with Sullivan's (1982a:
132-142 and 1982b) observation that offshore islands involving risk of access
exhibit an emphasis on the exploitation of specific resources. When it is
suggested that the mudflats developed, the composition of the deposit changes
to a much higher proportion of shell, agreeing with Sullivan's (1982a: 131
and 1982b) observation that islands in protected waters that require no major
effort to reach have middens resembling in composition those on the mainland.
     With only two radiocarbon dates, only hypotheses can be advanced as to
the increased rate of deposition and intensity of site use (Sullivan 1982a:
138 and 1982b) though seasonality studies may provide an insight into the
duration of visits to the island or its possible occupation. However, from
the analysis of the midden so far, there appears to be a distinct relation-
ship between the build-up of the mudflats and its composition. More geomor-
phological information is required to establish the regional history of
sediment accumulation and further excavation and analysis is required to
determine how representative this test pit is of the rest of the undisturbed
midden .
     The Holocene post marine transgression period saw dramatic changes in
coastal productivity, particularly in wide low relief margins of continental
shelves. The infilling of estuaries created in drowned river valleys produced
marked changes in biological productivity which in turn influenced the
resources available to hunter gatherers (Perlman 1980) . The relationship of
the exploitation of St Helena with the mainland and large Moreton Bay island
economies also needs investigating so that other variables such as resource
stress and population increase can be assessed. From the data available at
this stage, however, a model involving environmental change producing an
increase in resource availability and a decrease in exploitation risk provides
a testable explanation for the variability in the midden composition.
