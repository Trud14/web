Pursuant to a recent decision of the

Government, electric light is being in-

stalled in Brisbane Gaol. Similar steps

will probably be taken at St. Helena. It is

the intention of the Government to allow

prisoners with good records to have arti-

ficial light in their cells until 9 o'clock in

the evening. They will be allowed to read

until that hour, and a further instalment

of comfort will be the furnishing of their

quarters with more articles than they at

present possess. In short., gaols are be-

ing made such pleasant places people wor-

ried by the cares of business will soon be

glad to retire to such establishments for

a holiday. They will be saved the trou-

bles and expense of housekeeping, and

what with the good libraries and healthy

recreation and other luxuries provided,

the time will come when half the popu-

lation will be taxed to keep the other half

in what is vulgarly known as "quod!"
