St. Helena Relics.

The days of St. Helena as a prison settlement are numbered, but there are some grim
reminders of the past there. They include leg irons, which apparently were placed on
prisoners' legs permanently, and the handle of a lash. Preserved in a bottle are the third and
fourth fingers of a prisoner's left hand, which he cut off in a tinsmith's guillotine, so that he
would be sent to the Brisbane General Hospital, and so would have a chance to escape. He
did escape, but was caught some months afterwards. In a quiet corner of the island is the
prison cemetery, where there are about 50 graves, marked by stone crosses, bearing numbers,
but no names.
