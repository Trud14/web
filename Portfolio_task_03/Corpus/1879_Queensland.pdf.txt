       The Bishop of Northern Queensland (Dr. Sturton)
       oIbo preached on        Sunday, and what he said ap-                    ;




       peora     at   considerable        length       in both          the
       morning       papers.      The        Catholic        authorities
       have                         word                            is
                 passed tha                    that     there             to
       be no demonstration          .re the     Eev. Chiniquy, and
       the Church of England           is  passive.      To-night the
       '

          pastor' will give his first lecture, find then we
       Bhall ree      whether     everybody will keop their
       temper.
          Vfe are promised a good 'riddance of bad rub
       bish. The Government            have jndde up their mind
       to get rid of that eyesore to Brisbane               —
                                                                the gaol,
       and to remove      the prisoners to St. Helena, there
       to cultivate Eug-Rr.      The gaol will, when             the last
       prisoner has left it, be pulled down, and the site
       and material^ converted into hard cash, of which
       a   good amount       should be realised.              The      gaol
       is    not     only     an     eyesore,       but       it    is     a

       place      of   torture      as     well.       It      is    quite
       unfit  for  habitation, even     by prisoners, some of the
       cells, during hot weather,
                                            being veritable ovens,
       in which      the unhappy inmate            can     scarce    draw
       breath.      The prison, too, is considerably                 over

       looked by houses, and «s altogether demoralising
       to the crowded neighbourhood in which it stands.
       The preliminary «tep towards a complete clear out
       lias just been      taken by the Colonial Secretory,
       who    haa ju»t informed        the head gaoler and chief
       turnkey that their services will no longer be re
       quired.
          The preparations for the National Association's
       Show     in Bowen     Park are       going on apace. The
       exhibition      promises to be a                great success.
       It     will     be      a    sorb       of    rehearsal           for
       your     International      Exhibition.            Tho      public
       have responded well to the appeal made                    to them
       that the colony should be well represented in Syd
       ney.     It is fortunate we have euch an, RCtiveinati-
       iutioa es tha-Katioual Association.                Had *o not,


           I  fear we    should  have been too depressed by
           the bad times to have successfully exerted our
           aelvos in the matter of making a good display in
           Sydney.
             Things commercial     are
                                        mending very slowly ; so
        slowly, indeed, that the improvement is scarcely
        noticeable.      At the present moment        there is not a
       draper in town who is not selling off at a tremen
       dous sacrifice.       Strange to aay, these sellings-off
        are   not the delusions and the snares         they usually
       are.      The ladies are picking up Borne       decided bar
       gains, and the shopkeepers are             satisfied to have
       eoins    unaccustomed     cash in thoir tills.       Unfortu
       nately, the majority of us are too poor to avail our
       selves pf the opportunity of renewing our                  werd
       robesVt a cheap rate.
            We hn vo had a few public balls this winter, but
       the season, on the -whole, lias been by no means                a

       gay one.        Of amusements       there are     none, and
       the theatre and         School of Arts are both empty
       just now,      the Cora company         having vacated the
       latter last week after a rather so-so          season.       We
                            '          '
       are   promised a       farewell     visit by Joey
                                                            Gougen
       heiru shortly. Strange to                   have now        been
                                         Eay, we
       without      a  panorama     of the American           war    for
       some     weeks.     I cannot furnish you with a better
       proof than tliw of the depth to which we                    have
       fallen in the estimation of the show people.
