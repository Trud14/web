Moreton - A Bay of islands

About five miles from the mouth of the

Brisbane River is the island of St Helena.

This was, as the name implies, a penal

settlement for a number of years. It is

roughly about 500 acres in area, but much

of this consists of mangroves and perhaps

a little more than half may be cultivated,

some of it being a rich red basaltic soil in

which potatoes, lucerne and sugar-cane

have been the crops most successfully

grown. In 1868 an early settler, John Mc-

Donald, cleared ten acres of land there

to plant sugar-cane, which was grown by

convict labour. Though still under the

Crown, the island is now leased to private

holders, and dairying and pig-raising have

been carried on in recent years.
