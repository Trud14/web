    Prison Camps in Australia and the Historiography of
                                   Penal Change



On 31 October 1913, in the scrubby coastal sand dunes near Tuncurry, on the north coast
of New South Wales, five men made camp for the night. At the place they stopped stood
a hut in which one of them would sleep; the others pitched tents. They had come from
Goulburn, via Taree, and the journey had taken two days. Their bodies would have
welcomed the rest. They had lugged a great deal of equipment with them over the dunes,
four kilometres from the road—tools, building materials, kitchen utensils, clothes,
bedding, as well as a large quantity of food, with just one horse and cart. Sleep, however,
may have taken some time to come to them, tired as they were, for they knew that the
next day was the beginning of something new, and that much hinged on how they
conducted themselves here.1


Different events had led each man to this point. Those in the tents were convicted
criminals; the man in the hut their guard. Percy Whirls was a thief; Arthur Pratt a forger;
Frederick Harris a burglar; and Thomas Griffin was an embezzler. They were all over
twenty-five years old and none had any previous convictions. Their keeper was Charles
McArthur. A few days earlier, the 1200 hectares of land around the campsite had been
proclaimed the Prisoners Afforestation Camp, Tuncurry. They were there to build a
forest.2


The tents were in time replaced by huts, built by the men themselves. Once they had
finished their unwalled prison, they were to set to work on the dunes establishing the
state’s first pine plantation. For over two decades small groups of prisoners—never more
than forty at a time—cleared and burnt the scrub, planted exotic pine seedlings, built
firebreaks and kept the regrowth down. The prisoners’ huts were not locked at night, and

by day they worked in small groups or alone, often unsupervised and at considerable
distances from the camp.3


These were the undramatic beginnings of an important, but little-known development in
Australian penal history. The Tuncurry prison camp was the first penal institution that we
would now describe as a minimum security or open institution. Based on the belief that
honour, trust, outdoor labour, and limited freedom and would turn criminals into law-
abiding citizens, it was an expression of a new approach to the treatment of crime. Along
with a prison farm established at Emu Plains, just west of Sydney, it would become the
model from which this new mode of imprisonment spread across Australia.4


The first wave of construction in the Australian prison camp movement was brief, lasting
only from 1913 to 1916, and confined to NSW and Victoria. A second wave of camp-
building followed, as Australian economies crashed in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
When prison populations rose again during this time, institutions that were cheap to run
and quick to build became increasingly attractive to administrators and politicians around
the country. By 1937, every state possessed at least one such institution. Altogether, some
twenty-seven prison camps were established between 1913 and 1972, between them
confining tens of thousands of prisoners, providing work for hundreds of officers, and
affecting the lives of countless local residents.


The events at Tuncurry on 31 October 1913 were also the start of a story that sheds light
on the complex, often obscured dynamics of historical penal reform. A study of the
history of the camps furnishes new understandings of how and why the Australian penal
systems have changed over time. This thesis is the first attempt to tell, and to interpret
this story.


The spread of the prison camp movement around the country, and its subsequent
development are dealt with in this chapter, as is the relevant historiography. The chapter
concludes with an outline of the remainder of the thesis.

  In NSW the forestry camps such as that at Tuncurry were originally known as Prisoners’
Afforestation Camps while the farms like those like Emu Plains were referred to as Prison Farms.
They were however, essentially, part of the same movement in penal reform, and for the sake of
simplicity, I will refer to both types of prison as ‘prison camps’.

TUNCURRY AND EMU PLAINS: ‘A DARING INNOVATION’


In 1913, no one knew whether or not this new sort of prison would prove a success, but
the initial indications were promising. Despite the degree of liberty granted the prisoners
at Tuncurry, escapes were few. The prisoners worked enthusiastically, the trees grew well
at first, recidivism rates were low, and the cost of running the camp compared favourably
to that incurred by a conventional prison. Local residents were so impressed with the
work performed by their unusual neighbours that many of them offered jobs to
discharged prisoners.5 Positive effects were observed not just in the prisoners at the camp,
but throughout the prison population. With ‘joyful satisfaction’, the Anglican Chaplain to
Goulburn Prison noted that the Tuncurry camp ‘is exerting a good influence among the
men still in gaol, for it is something to look forward to, to hope for, and work for’.6


Outsiders also judged the camp a great success. H. M. Vaughan, the South Australian
Attorney General, visiting NSW to study the ‘the daring innovation’ at Tuncurry, saw a
system which allowed individuals ‘who have made a mistake or a slip in life to drop into
surroundings and a mode of life which will tend to make them men and not flunkeys’.7


At least some of prisoners were convinced of the merits of the scheme, too. The Reverend
Schmitzer reported that his charges at Tuncurry were ‘unanimous’ that their experience at
the camp would ‘enable them face the world after the sojourn at the Camp—stronger
physically, mentally, and morally’.8 A few prisoners put their gratitude directly onto
paper. One wrote shortly after his discharge: ‘If it were not that I am married, I would be
quite content to stay’. Another declared he wished


        to tender my heartfelt gratitude and thanks for sending me to Tuncurry and my
        appreciation of the humane treatment I received during my eight months’
        detention there … the man who becomes a criminal after leaving there under
        existing conditions is, in my opinion, a bad man indeed.9

The camp was, according to the Newcastle Herald, a sign that ‘we have a system in this
State which represents many of the most modern ideas connected with the reformation of
the criminal’.11


A little over a year after the camp at Tuncurry opened, just as Australian soldiers were
embarking ships to Europe, the NSW Justice Minister David Hall opened a similar
institution on the western banks of the Nepean River at the foot of the Blue Mountains.
The Emu Plains Prison Farm, as it was called, was established in December 1914 on
forty-three hectares of fertile alluvial floodplain farmland. Under conditions similar to
those at Tuncurry, the young offenders at Emu Plains worked on their honour under the
light supervision of unarmed guards, and slept at night in small wooden huts.12 Tacked to
the inside of the door to each prisoner’s hut was a notice written by the CGP:


        The changed conditions under which you now find yourself, will, I trust, appeal
        to you and to your sense of honour, and that you will realise that a special
        opportunity is now afforded you to improve yourself in every way, and to cut
        away from gaol life for good and all, and that you will show by your conduct
        during the remainder of your sentence that you will appreciate in the fullest

        degree the efforts made to enable you to regain your self-respect, and to fit you
        for a fresh start in life, along better lines than those that caused your temporary
        lapse. You can see, and no doubt realise, by your new surroundings what is
        before you in the great change effected for your welfare; and with yourself rests
        the effect of it upon your future.13


The judiciary was impressed with the new prison. In June 1916, as he passed sentence on
a young prisoner at Quarter Sessions in Sydney, Judge Bevan spoke of his long-standing
reluctance to send young men to prison. Having seen the prison farm at Emu Plains
though, he thought it ‘far better that they should be there than roaming about outside … it
is a curious thing that after all these years we find that harshness does no good, but
clemency does an enormous amount of good’.14 Over a decade later, Emu Plains made a
similar impression on Judge Bevan’s colleague, Philip Whistler Street, the Chief Justice
of NSW. Street told the annual meeting of the Prisoners’ Aid Association in 1927:


        To see those young men in that peaceful rural atmosphere, bathed in sunshine,
        living in separate cubicles in the open, without any detaining walls except their
        word of honor … was to realize the value, not only to those young men, but to
        the community to which they would shortly be returned, of the prison farm
        treatment as a means of reform.15


By 1926 ‘the gaol look’ had been eliminated from the outfits of the Emu Plains inmates,
they were being trained in physical culture, and selected inmates were permitted short
furloughs in which they left the farm to attend to pressing family business, such as
illnesses or funerals, on the condition that they returned.16


In 1938, Hall, the former Minister of Justice, returned as a visitor to the prison he had
founded more than two decades earlier. The visitors’ book recorded his thoughts: ‘Of all

the work I did during a long Parliamentary career, there is none which I contemplate with
more satisfaction than the Emu Plains Prison Farm. It has fulfilled my best expectations.17


Only a few commentators were unconvinced of the merits of the new prisons. Shortly
after the Tuncurry camp opened in 1913, a well-informed critic writing in The Bulletin
under the pseudonym ‘Lex’ offered a rare piece of dissent from the prevailing enthusiasm
when he detected ‘lurking’ in the scheme ‘the wish … to give the NSW prisoner as good
a time as possible’.18 Few shared Lex’s reservations, though, and the seeming success of
the camp soon silenced any remaining doubters. Having inspected prisons in several
Commonwealth countries, John Fitzgerald, Hall’s successor as NSW Justice Minister,
said he was positive


         that the system in operation at the Emu Plains and Tuncurry establishments for
         the treatment and reform of delinquents surpasses in its humanitarianism and
         reformative results anything to be seen elsewhere in the world.19

very different type of prisoner, there is still a prison at the Emu Plains site, making it one of the
oldest penal institutions in the country.

In the late 1920s, during William McKell’s second term as Minister of Justice, the NSW
prison camp system was expanded. The Brookfield Afforestation Camp, Mannus—later
known as the Mannus Afforestation Camp or Mannus Prison Camp—was proclaimed in
February 1927 in the NSW southern highlands, near Tumbarumba. There, on an old
soldier settlement block, authorities hoped that penal afforestation would fight back an
invasion of St John’s Wort that had driven out the settlers.21 The Brookfield Afforestation
Camp, Mila, near Bombala—more commonly known as the Bombala Afforestation
Camp—received its first transfer of prisoners arriving shortly after it was proclaimed in
March 1927.22


McKell’s successor, John R. Lee continued the expansion of the system, proclaiming two
more camps: the Mount Mitchell Afforestation Camp, near Glen Innes on the northern
tablelands, in June 1928, and the Oberon Afforestation Camp, in the Blue Mountains,
which opened in September 1930.23 In 1930 Lee also established a road-building camp at
Cowan Creek to build a scenic road through the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. This
camp was run on similar lines to the afforestation camps, but it attracted bitter opposition
from labour groups and others, and was closed after only a few months.24 An additional
camp, the Newnes Afforestation Camp, opened in 1967.25


While the camps were taken to be self-evidently humane, their success was measured in
several ways. Discipline at camp was generally much better than in the walled prisons,
with very few prisoners punished for breaches of gaol regulations. Only one riot in a
NSW prison camp was ever reported.26 The camps were cheap to run, too. Prison
administrators, conscious of the cost of keeping their charges, had long pursued the
dream of an entirely self-supporting prison, and while most of the camps did not reach

this mark, they were certainly economically attractive. In 1930, at a time when the daily
average number of prisoners held in the entire NSW penal system was just over 1900, the
camps, when full, provided accommodation for around 300 inmates altogether,
approximately the same number as Bathurst Gaol, one of the state’s largest prisons.27
Bathurst alone was erected at a cost of £101,655, whereas the aggregate cost of the camps
in 1930 was in the order of £25,000.28


For administrators and politicians, the ultimate proof of the success of the scheme was its
effect on recidivism. Of every three prisoners released from Bathurst, two, on average,
could expect to return to prison at some stage. Over the course of sixteen years at
Tuncurry, however, only five per cent of the 812 (specially-selected prisoners) were
reconvicted in a NSW court.29 When the Tuncurry camp was closed in April 1938, well
over a thousand prisoners had passed through it.30 ‘Our prison farms point the way to
salvation’, journalist Jack Creagh wrote in 1938.31




A NEW DEPARTURE IN PENAL REFORM


The success and good publicity of the camp at Tuncurry and the prison farm at Emu
Plains prompted reform along similar lines in the other states.32




Victoria


In July 1916 the Victorian Government approved the purchase of a farm near
Castlemaine Prison and the establishment of an afforestation camp on French Island, near

   Although this dissertation examines the prison camp movement across Australia, the NSW
experience is privileged to some extent. The NSW camp system was the first in the country, and
the model for those that followed. It was also one of the largest and best documented.

Phillip Island in Westernport Bay.33 The Inspector General, William Callaway had been
agitating in favour of this for some time. In 1915, writing as ‘an advocate for love as a
dominating impulse as against fear’ he surveyed the prison farm experiments made in
NSW, and stated that ‘similar experiments might be undertaken here’.34 By the end of
1916, seventeen prisoners were at the island camp, known as the McLeod Settlement, and
were reported to be making good progress in erecting a permanent camp and establishing
a pine plantation.35


As at Tuncurry, the early results of work at the McLeod camp were promising.36 The
Chief Superintendent of State Nurseries and Plantations thought the forestry work being
carried out by the prisoners was ‘equal to that performed … by free labour’. Donald
McLeod, the Chief Secretary—after whom the camp was named—believed it could
become self-supporting in a short space of time.37

The Department of Penal Establishments was responsible for the day-to-day running of
the camp, but the management of the institution was in the hands of a body called the
Indeterminate Sentences Board (ISB).39 The members of the board thought that the
success of the place depended on making McLeod appear as little like a prison as
possible: ‘The prison aspect has been left out of the settlement in every way compatible
with safety’.40 Sports days with visitors from the mainland were organised and on these
occasions prisoners were permitted to wear their own civilian clothes.41


Visitors from interstate and overseas came to observe the experiment for themselves, and
expressed themselves well satisfied with what they saw. Major Tom Beaston, the Texan
Director of Prisons, visited Australia in 1922 to inquire into Australian penal methods. In
his opinion, the camp was ‘one of the best experimental penitentiaries … in the world’.42
The results at McLeod were all the more striking, because unlike the initial prisoners at
Tuncurry who were first offenders convicted of relatively minor offences, those at
McLeod were older men, who had been designated habitual criminals. Meanwhile, the
Castlemaine farm held younger, first-time prisoners.


As at Tuncurry, ex-prisoners from McLeod wrote to the authorities to express their
gratitude for their treatment on the island. The ‘life and the Island and the trust’ placed in
one such man gave him confidence in himself, he told the ISB, ‘to face the world’. ‘It
may seem strange,’ wrote another former inmate, not long after his release, ‘but I will
always cherish kindly recollections of my sojourn at the Island because it brought me to
myself’.43 According to a third, McLeod Settlement was ‘the best place in the world for
re-making men’.44

letters in it’s annual reports, as proof of the wisdom of the scheme. However, the letters should be
seen in context. Many were received from men still under the power of the board, who were
serving a two-year probationary period, to ‘test’ their readiness for liberty. At any stage during this
time, the board could take the probationer back into custody if it felt he or she had failed to meet

authorities what they wanted to hear.

Victoria’s third camp, the Cooriemungle Prison Farm, was built in 1939.45 Modelled on
institutions in New Zealand, and located in the Heytesbury Forest at the western fringe of
the Otway Ranges, Cooriemungle was effectively a deforestation camp. Prisoners cleared
blocks of land of thick native forest, so that they could then be handed over to private
settlers.46


In 1950, Castlemaine and its satellite farm were closed and the Langi Kal Kal Training
Centre, a prison farm for young offenders, was opened at Trawalla, 140 kilometres west
of Melbourne.47 Later, two reforestation camps were established in the Strzelecki Ranges,
southeast of Melbourne: the Morwell River Reforestation Prison and Won Wron
Reforestation Prison opened in 1961 and 1963 respectively. The Dhurringile Prison Farm,
north of Melbourne, was added to Victoria’s penal system in 1965.48




Queensland


The First World War put a temporary halt to many public projects across the country,
including prison reform. In 1921, however, the prison on the island of St Helena, off the
coast of southern Queensland was converted to a prison farm.49 Officials at the time saw
change on the island as part of the wave of reform from the south. There had been a large
prison on the island since the 1860s, and as part of the conversion, the inmates were put
to work dismantling the old cell-block buildings.50 Writing shortly after this work began,
the Comptroller-General announced that:

traditional law were exiled. Rod Wise, ‘Cooriemungle’, information sheet, c.1990, CRVC.

   There is an interesting story behind the island’s name. In the early nineteenth century, it was
briefly used as a place of confinement for an Aboriginal man who had repeatedly run foul of
colonial officials. To British eyes, the man’s profile bore a resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte’s,
so the island became known as St Helena, after the island on which the French leader was
imprisoned. Jarvis Finger, True Tales of Old St Helena, Booralong Publications, Brisbane, 1986,

        The whole of the new system is formed on the principle of reformation, and not
        with a vindictive desire to punish, which would be to the detriment of the
        recognised principle of humanitarian treatment. The scheme has proved itself to
        be a very great success. It has even reached a success far beyond my
        expectations.51


This prison farm did not last long: it was closed in 1933, following significant public
pressure for its removal, so that the island might be re-made into a beauty spot for boaters
and picnickers.52 A year later however, six prisoners set out with a sole officer to
establish the Palen Creek prison farm in the foothills of the Macpherson Ranges in the
southeast of the state. It was, according to CGP William Gall, ‘a distinct advance in the
methods of penal administration’.53

On any given day in 1936, approximately twenty of the 330 or so prisoners under
sentence in Queensland’s prisons could be found at Palen Creek, even a number of men
convicted of crimes of a sexual and/or violent nature. The inmates cultivated crops and
planted pines. They also erected fences, built roads, and constructed a laundry, pump
shed, power house, kitchen, tanks, wells, garage, woodwork shop, and blacksmith’s
shop.55 The Melbourne Herald noted admiringly that not only did the farm save the state
government ‘hundreds of pounds annually’, but that its amicable workings rendered it a
prison in name only.56 By 1938, it was no longer even called a prison; it was officially
known as the State Farm, Palen Creek.57


In 1940, the Home Secretary, E. M. Hanlon announced that another two state farms
would be created. The Numinbah and Whitinbah State Farms were established in the
Numinbah Valley, in the Nerang district, not far from the Gold Coast.58 A fourth farm
followed in the north, in 1945, at Stone River, near Ingham, around 130 kilometres
northwest of Townsville.59 By 1954 around fifteen per cent of the state’s prison
population was confined on one farm or another.60




Western Australia


Western Australia created its first prison camp in 1927. The Pardelup Prison Farm was
established about thirty kilometres from Mount Barker on an old pastoral estate of 3000
hectares.61 The first batch of inmates consisted of four men, who arrived in civilian

clothes, uncuffed, and accompanied by a single warder.62 As at the McLeod Settlement
and the Palen Creek State Farm, prisoners at Pardelup performed both agricultural and
sylvicultural work. Dubbed, ‘a school for regeneration’ by the press, the farm was hailed
as a high-water mark in penal reform.63 Pardelup’s political architect, Chief Secretary
John Michael Drew, insisted that whereas the prisoner was once ‘regarded as an outcast
without hope of reclamation’, he or she should instead be ‘treated as a human being’.64
Drew later spoke of his pride on the day he signed the papers that brought the prison farm
into being.65


Inmates were received at Pardelup under fixed and indeterminate sentences, and worked
both the fields and the forests. They tended the property’s orchard, garden and fields.
They cleared the jarrah, red gum, yate, blackbutt and paperbark that covered much of the
estate, and gradually replaced it with pines.66 They kept sheep and cattle, and they made
jam. They played cricket and football amongst themselves and with locals, staged
concerts and helped neighbouring settlers fight fires on their properties. They slept in an
unlocked dormitory, and ate in each other’s company.67 ‘The aim’, Drew declared, was
‘to rob the environment of any suggestion of prison life’.68


For many years Pardelup was Western Australia’s only prison farm. The Karnet Prison
Farm was not established until March 1963. Situated near Serpentine, seventy-three
kilometres south of Perth, Karnet catered largely for prisoners with alcohol problems.69
The Wooroloo Prison Farm, a little over fifty kilometres east of Perth followed in 1972.70

South Australia


South Australia’s first prison camp opened on 22 March 1932, although plans had been in
preparation since 1915.71 The Kyeema Afforestation Camp (later the Kyeema Prison
Camp), in the South Mount Lofty Ranges, was a little over sixty kilometres from
Adelaide, on 435 hectares of stringybark forest country, which was to be cleared and
planted with pines.72 The name of the camp was reported to be a Kaurna word, meaning
‘dawn’.73


The advance party of eight prisoners and two guards slept in tents as they prepared the
camp for those who would come after. Although it was hoped at first that as many as
forty prisoners would be held at Kyeema, it remained a small camp, with usually only
around thirteen inmates at any one time.74 The weather made early conditions difficult,
but by September the camp was hailed as ‘the most humane’ development in the history
of the South Australian penal system.75 The substance of this advanced penology was,
more or less, setting men to work at hewing wood and drawing water. The prisoners cut a
road through the rain-soaked forest to the camp. They sank wells, grew their own
vegetables, carted water from the creek when the wells failed, showered from buckets, cut
firewood, planted trees, put up fences and built bridges.76 Like inmates at other camps,
they were called by name, not number, paid at a higher rate for their labours than other
prisoners and when their work was done they were allowed to ‘yarn, read or play
dominoes’.77


Visitors to Kyeema were impressed with what they saw. In the camp’s visitors’ book, J.
A. Whibley of Willunga called it ‘an enlightenment’. F. J. Barnes saw the financial sense
in the scheme, calling it ‘a wonderfully wise investment’. Others saw overtones of
Christian love. According to D. Dickson of Meadows, the camp represented ‘The Gospel

comments were less gushing, such as J. B. Daly’s: ‘Good. But I hope I never come

Tasmania


Tasmania was the last state to establish a prison camp. The Kilderry Gaol Farm (later
known as Hayes Prison Farm), was established in 1937, and was located on an old 560-
hectare farm property in the Derwent Valley.79 When the farm’s political sponsor, the
Attorney General E. G. Ogilvie, visited the farm in August 1937, he told the prisoners
there:


           This is your farm … you are the custodians of a system designed to make better
           men and give you your self respect and the goodwill of the people of Tasmania
           back again. Remember it is your home and it is up to you to protect its good
           name. You are your brothers’ keeper.80


Within a year the press declared that ‘the modern system of prison reform has proved a
success’ and that the farm was ‘a lesson in what is possible in regard to the rehabilitation
of men’s characters under a modern prison system’.81

‘FARMS ARE BETTER THAN JAILS’82: THE END OF THE PRISON?


The prison camps emerged during the mid-1910s, an important moment in Australian
penal history. At no time, before or since, have we been closer to the possibility that the
prison, as it has been traditionally understood, might be done away with. In 1918, the
NSW prison population had sunk to its lowest level since 1873.83 When William McKell
visited Emu Plains in July of 1920, he announced that no first offender would see the
inside of a walled prison.84 By this time, Darlinghurst Gaol had been closed for eight
years, and Parramatta Gaol for two years.85 In Victoria in 1921, the ISB noted a nascent
trend in penal policy in several countries toward ‘the abandonment of the orthodox gaol,
with its gloomy walls and atmosphere, and a good deal of success is attending the
endeavours to reclaim even hardened criminals, under conditions more healthy and
natural’.86 At more or less the same time, the suggestion was floated by a subcommittee
of the Victorian State Cabinet that conditions like those at French Island might ‘be
extended to include all of the men committed from the Victorian courts for extended
periods’.87


When John R. Lee took up office as NSW Minister for Justice in 1927, he noticed a
‘world-wide move involving new principles in the punishment of crime’. Prison camps,
in particular, were more and more widely used. Noting the development of the Borstal
system in the United Kingdom for young offenders, and the successful use of camp
systems in the United States and New Zealand, Lee felt the NSW camp system ‘was
bound to extend because of the inherent humanity and justice at the back of it’. The
prison population was on the rise again by this stage, and the financial savings the camps
promised were attractive. Lee claimed a new gaol for two hundred men would cost in the
order of £50,000 while new camps to hold three times as many would cost only £400.

‘Gaols of the … old type, breed desperate men’, he wrote, explaining ‘why I won’t build
any new gaols’.88


During a visit to Geelong Gaol in 1933, Joseph Akeroyd, the Victorian Inspector-
General, assured a group of prison officials and reporters that ‘the present gaol system
would be gradually replaced by prison camps’.89 In 1937 the NSW Justice Minister,
Lewis Martin told a Rotary meeting in Newcastle: ‘One thing is certain. We will build no
more prisons. The camp has definitely established itself as the proper method both for
reformation and for cheapness’.90 The ideal mode of imprisonment, it seems, was
imprisonment in name only.


For politicians and bureaucrats, the letters received from former camp inmates could only
have strengthened such sentiments. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Patrick Roche, the
Superintendent of H. M. Prison Farm, St Helena received a number of such letters. One
of his correspondents thought it was ‘a matter of time before there will be less of the
criminal element’, thanks to the prison camp movement. Another of Roche’s former
inmates expressed his relief and gratitude at doing his time at St Helena, rather than in the
gaol at Boggo Road, in Brisbane. ‘One only has to visit the prison at Brisbane and see on
the faces of the men the expression of dogged and sullen hatred,’ he wrote.91 According
to a third, there was at St Helena:


        a system of life where a man is made to feel he is still a man… Had I to finish my
        time at the Road my outlook on life could have been prejudiced to such an extent
        that I would not have been able to write as I am doing now.92

Shrinking prison populations were taken as another sign of the value of the camps. As the
NSW prison population dipped yet again after the Great Depression, one penal official
was reported attributing much of the great decline to prison camp treatment, on which, he
said ‘we are pinning our faith’. The reconviction rate at the Tuncurry camp was around
five per cent, according to this official. ‘Something happens to them after this sort of
treatment,’ he said. ‘They see things a bit differently and disappear from our lives’.93
With the conventional prisons at Long Bay and Parramatta racked by hunger strikes and
assaults on warders, the way of the future, Martin suggested, lay in the conversion of old
gaols to prison camps.94 Bathurst, Goulburn and Maitland Gaols were, he said, not half
full and two of them could be closed. Such a shift would serve the interests of economy
as well as humanity. The cost of maintaining a prisoner for a year at the gaol at Broken
Hill was £336, while the cost of keeping the same prison at Emu Plains was a mere £82.
‘What the prisoners grow they are allowed to eat, the costs are kept down, and the final
results are better than anything elsewhere,’ the Minister said.95 Shortly before he died, the
former CGP Samuel McCauley, the originator of many of the camps in NSW, told a
journalist: ‘I feel the farm system can be applied to all classes of offenders’.96


Time showed that these prophecies were pitched too high. Even at its peak, the NSW
camp system held only about twelve per cent of the state’s prisoners, and much of the
momentum of the prison reform movement evaporated as soon as the Second World War
broke out.97 Into the 1950s however, there remained a sense that the camps were more
than merely modifications of the conditions of imprisonment—they were institutions of a
different order. This was best exemplified in Queensland, where for very many years,
prison farms were officially known as ‘State Farms’, long before the Prisons Department
changed its own name. CGP, William Rutherford wrote in 1955, ‘the word PRISON [is]
omitted in an endeavour to remove the name of prison from the minds of the prisoners
there’.98 Rutherford described Queensland’s prison camps as ‘our best contribution to
penology’.99

PRISON CAMPS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR


The engine of prison reform had idled during the Second World War, and once peace
returned, the original hopes for the camps seemed out of step with the times, and
prisoners and officials became increasingly dissatisfied with them. By the 1950s, the
reform impulse associated with the movement had been well and truly checked (except to
a temporary extent in Queensland).100 The buildings, farms and forests remained, and
indeed a third wave of construction took place in the 1950s and 1960s, but penological
theory was changing, as were both the prison population, and society as a whole.


Across Australia—and much of the world—prison populations rose sharply in the late
1950s. A number of states were unprepared and accommodation became perilously
stretched.101 Unrest became increasingly common behind the walls, and reformers
became interested in new schemes or large-scale extensions of old ideas, particularly non-
custodial options such as probation and parole. Generally, those prisoners selected for the
camps had been the better-behaved, less troublesome types. With this type of offender
now increasingly avoiding prison altogether, prison administrators were forced to send a
more difficult class of prisoner to the camps, which became release valves for the
overflowing prison populations.102 Meanwhile, the privileges available to inmates at
camps were no longer novel, and prisoners took them more or less for granted.103




prison began decades earlier. On another occasion, Rutherford wrote: ‘great care is taken to avoid
the use of the word Prison for psychological reasons’. W. Rutherford ‘State Farms in Queensland,

    A few optimists continued to advocate the replacement of the prison by the camp, but they were
few in number, and generally unheeded. This sentiment lingered longest in Queensland. See:

According to former NSW Comptroller, John Morony, the new camps of the 1950s and
1960s were only built because of ‘the unavailability of large scale funds for prisons of
greater security’.104 Other prisons, such as that at Grafton in NSW, were set aside with
increased security for the worst-behaved or ‘intractable’ prisoners. Thus, the post-war
period saw the emergence of a spectrum of differentiated penal institutions, giving
administrators a finely graded set of carrots and sticks with which to manage and
manipulate inmate behaviour. When, for instance, in 1975, P. C., a prisoner at the
McLeod Prison Farm displayed continued insolence to staff, the Governor J. D., told his
superiors: ‘in my opinion [P. C.] is in need of a prolonged dose of ‘H’ Division, and
unless he changes his attitude he is a certainty for it’.105 Conversely, transfer to camp
could be used as an inducement to good behaviour in the prison.106 At the Cadell Training
Centre, which opened in 1960, the carrot and the stick occupied the same site. Inmates at
the minimum security prison farm laboured in the shadow of the walls of the maximum
security prison immediately adjacent.107


A promotional film produced by the NSW Department of Prisons in 1956 outlined the
range of institutions in NSW, focussing on the maximum security prison for intractable
inmates at Grafton, the prison for first offenders at Goulburn, the Berrima Training
Centre, and the Emu Plains Prison Farm:


        The release preparations of Emu Plains, the impersonal unbending security of
        Grafton, the habit changing discipline of Goulburn, the communal training of
        Berrima; all these have their place in the design. All these have their place in the
        scheme to train prisoners for citizenship.108

places’. See: ‘Prison Without Bars’, Sunday Herald, 26 July 1953.

Bob Johnson, a journalist for The Sun Herald wondered ‘why there should be a place
like’ Grafton Prison ‘in a civilised community’. The Prisons Department claimed ‘it
makes possible the wide range of other gaols, training centres and prison camps’.109 CGP
Leslie Nott set aside Grafton for the state’s intractable prisoners in 1943 for this very
reason. The dreaded ‘end-of-the-line’ prison ‘provided the underpinning for the relaxed
discipline of the expanded prison camps’.110


In the end, the prison camps became little more than penal transit lounges, for prisoners
en route to freedom from conventional prisons. One NSW prison officer described them
as ‘decompression chambers’.111 In these ways, the camp systems became integral
adjuncts to the types of prisons it was once hoped they might replace. Instead of replacing
the conventional prison, the camps ended up ensuring that the grim, high-walled keeps
never went away.




THE HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PENAL CHANGE


Several questions arise from this account of the history of the Australian prison camps.
How are we to make sense of this narrative? What causes can be identified to explain
these developments? As an exercise in prison reform, why did the camps emerge when
they did, and why did they take their particular forms? What principles were the camps
based on, and how did they work in practice? Given the extraordinary optimism on which
they were based, how should we explain the problems the camps faced after the Second
World War?


Next to nothing has been written about the history of the camps to date. Indeed, the
history of imprisonment in Australia in general is a lightly worked field, and for the most
part, the relevant works are of little assistance in answering these questions. Prison camps

have formed part of other countries’ penal systems, and although the international
literature offers many useful insights into the process of penal change, it provides no
model for understanding the place of prison camps within this process.


The general lack of interest on the part of historians in the history of imprisonment in
Australia is difficult to account for. The Australian colonies were founded as penal
experiments, and the Australian historiography is awash with studies of convicts—their
experiences, the reasons for their transportation, the brutality they suffered or did not
suffer, and so on.112 Curiously though, we remain remarkably ignorant of the history of
domestic punishment in Australia after the end of the transportation period. It is not clear
whether this is because historians regard the history of punishment to have effectively
ended with the development of the penitentiary; or because ‘common criminals’ are seen
to lack the romance or drama now associated with convicts; or because prison records are
significantly more difficult to access than convict sources.113 Reaching the sources is a
real difficulty—even Royal Commissioners have found locating contemporary prison
records a challenge.114 Even after the records are located and permission to use them
obtained, there are difficulties to be confronted. The partial, euphemistic, often self-
serving nature of the sources makes penal institutions ‘notoriously difficult subjects’ for
historians.115 Yet, these difficulties have not deterred scholars working in penal history in
other countries, or Australian historians working in other sensitive areas, such as the
history of child welfare or Aboriginal history. Whatever the case, this neglect has left us
with largely unrefined understandings of how and why our penal systems have evolved in
the period since transportation ceased.


There is a small body of work on Australian penal history, but most of the texts are
official accounts, written by current or retired departmental staff, or by commissioned

authors, and they have their limitations.116 According to Peter Lynn and George
Armstrong, the authors of the official history of the Victorian prison system, their intents
in writing the book were to ‘examine the development of the penal system and assess the
men who wielded enormous power in administering it’.117 This is not surprising, when it
is remembered that Armstrong was once the governor of Victoria’s main prison, and
Lynn was the Director of the Department of Prisons. Their narrative recounts the
emergence of the practices and architecture best suited to dealing with the problem of
criminal behaviour, following a line from the unenlightened past to the humanitarian
present. Milestones along the road to ‘the development of a more humane system with
improved facilities,’ are noted with satisfaction. but little attempt is made to understand
the causes and effects of reform.118 The experience of prisoners is at most a sidelight.
Prison camps, of which Victoria has had several are barely mentioned, and of their
origins and operations we learn almost nothing.


Of all the Australian penal systems, that of NSW is the most thoroughly chronicled. The
official history of this system is John Ramsland’s With Just But Relentless Discipline.
Ramsland is the Honorary Historian of the NSW Correctives Services Department, and
the voice that he captures is, as in Lynn and Armstrong’s work, that of the administrators.
Ramsland presents the only treatment of the history of prison camps in any state in
Australia, but he relies almost exclusively on details from the Prisons Department’s
annual reports. As a result, the establishment and operation of the camps is simply slotted
into the smooth, progressive trajectory of enlightened reform: the camps were ‘well
conceived experiments that continue to be used today’.119 Discussed under the rubric, the
‘age of modernity’ (1913–1996), he says they were ‘stunningly successful, both in terms
of productivity and the moral and physical health of prisoners’.120 Ramsland makes no
attempt to explain why and how the prison camps emerged at the time they did, beyond

    Only the penal systems of NSW, Victoria and South Australia are surveyed in such works; the
prisons systems of Queensland, Western Australia, and the Territories lack even officially
sanctioned chronicles, although they are documented to an extent in the histories of individual
prisons (also, for the most part, written by commissioned authors); see below for more on these.

noting that it was a time of ‘great social experimentation’ generally, and that they were
economically attractive and self-evidently sensible.121


John Morony’s self-published The More Things Change is an interesting contrast to
Ramsland’s book. Morony served for many years as the leading prison official in NSW
and he presented a deeper, more sympathetic understanding of penal history and prisoner
experience, as well as a brief, but useful discussion of the NSW camp system. As his title
suggests, Morony saw the history of punishment as cyclical rather than progressive.
‘Again and again one is faced with the fact that most, if not all penological innovations
have already been tried, discarded and tried again’, he wrote.122 Nevertheless, he offered
no sustained analysis of penal change, and he buried his insights under a great mass of
unsynthesised detail.


Jonathan Telfer’s Duty of Care: A Brief History of Correctional Practices in South
Australia is a particularly awkward patchwork of facts. Like Morony, Telfer worked for
many years within the penal system he wrote of, and he clearly cared deeply about it.
‘The history of imprisonment’, Telfer tells us, ‘is a history of change, augmented by
threads of continuity’.123 Unfortunately, these fine distinctions are quickly lost in the
telling, under a blanket of confused detail from other secondary sources.


Similarly, Sean O’Toole’s The History of Australian Corrections, relies on little original
research. It is also marred by anachronism, teleology and plain error. At the time of
writing the book, O’Toole was the director of Learning and Development for the NSW
Department of Community Services, and many passages in the book read as if lifted from
contemporary mission statements. He writes, for instance, of ‘the challenges offered by
difficult clients’ that come into the ‘care’ of departments of corrections. ‘At the close of
the 20th century’, he adds


        Australia’s correctional systems had changed profoundly to deliver a system of
        justice that meets the expectations of modern society… Corrections is now a
        human services business, not the punishment business that it once was.

The book is the only ‘authorised’ history to venture beyond the confines of a single state,
and deserves to be commended for this reason. Not much more can be said in the book’s
favour, as both historians and criminologists have noted. Based entirely on other
secondary sources or official sources meant for public consumption, it is ‘history served
up simply, untrammeled by troubling questions of interpretation, or the unsettling
evidence of the archives’.124


Aside from the official histories, there is a branch of prison history, that is properly
understood as a specialisation of architectural history. The most prominent practitioners
of this work in Australia are Joan and James Kerr. Their book, Out of Sight, Out of Mind,
is one of the few works in the field with a national scope, and it seeks to bridge the divide
between convict history and prison history.125 However, despite its claim to cover the
period 1788–1988, the book leaps inexplicably from 1908 to 1963, and the Kerrs clearly
did not regard prison camps as part of the history of penal architecture. Yet, as we shall
see, neither the emergence of the prison camps, nor the history of Australian penal
architecture generally, can be understood in isolation from each other.


There is a small, uneven collection of texts, mainly theses and articles, which can not be
classified as either official or architectural histories. Some of these are fine pieces of
scholarship. Many, however, recapitulate the difficulties of the official histories. A. R. G.
Griffiths’ ‘A History of South Australian Prisons’, for instance, is unequivocally a
narrative of the successful development of South Australia’s prison system—‘the triumph
of optimism’. South Australia’s prison camps were, in Griffiths’ brief account, beacons of
this progressive transformation.126

national and comparative analysis is so thin on the ground. As P. N. Grabosky observed, the
Australian colonies/states offer ‘a natural laboratory for historical research. Six different criminal
justice systems, all derived from the British model, each evolving … over a period in excess of a
century and a half, invite comparative analysis’. See Grabosky ‘On the History of Punishment in

Paul Alliston’s and Diane Payne’s honours theses on the NSW prison system, both
written in 1968, offer much the same picture of reform as Griffiths did: a grim past,
steadily ameliorated by wise administrators. They also briefly cite the prison camps as
proof of this process.127 Merrilyn Lee Sernack Cruise’s PhD thesis on the former NSW
CGP Frederick Neitenstein offers a more sophisticated analysis, and Sernack Cruise is
one of the very few historians who have refused to take at face value the claims made for
the camps by their originators and supporters. Nevertheless, here too, reform is boiled
down to the wisdom and energy of an individual—to ‘leadership and style’.128


Various aspects of the penal histories of each state are explored in an assortment of
scholarly articles. These are for the most part written in isolation, often by writers with
little ongoing interest in the broader pictures of penal history, but they do offer useful
insights into the process of penal change. Christopher Mead for instance, in his 1991
article on the NSW prison system from 1866-1914, shows how the motifs of humane,
modern reform and the barbaric past are constantly reiterated in penal discourse, driving
change for change’s sake. An institution once regarded as ‘the model of humane reform’
such as Darlinghurst or Berrima prison, could in only a few decades become considered
‘a shocking example of barbarity and inhumanity’.129 A ‘penal teleology’, in which
reform begins with the latest and most advanced ‘blueprint’ from overseas invariably
renders pre-existing practices obsolete and ‘desperately inadequate’. Thus ‘one prison’s
failure meant another prison must succeed. The prison offered the possibility of change,
but only ever the possibility’.130 Mead’s analysis informs chapter two of this thesis.


Other writers have assessed the causes as well as the cyclical nature of reform. Stephen
Garton, for instance, has written a number of perceptive articles touching on the penal

the camps were based on; for more on this see chapter two. Other theses of interest to the historian

history of NSW in the decades around the turn of the twentieth century, focussing
particularly on the ways this history intersects with the histories of madness and eugenics
in Australia. Reform, Garton shows, is driven not necessarily by leaders or figures with
clear agendas, but by contradictory movements. There were many conflicting approaches
to crime and punishment in the early twentieth century, he writes ‘yet some of the
differing ideas coalesced into common reform strategies’.131


John McGuire’s 2002 PhD thesis on the processes of penal change in Queensland from
1859 to the 1930s puts flesh on the bones of Garton’s observation. On the basis of his
meticulous survey of the primary evidence—a rarity in the Australian
historiography—McGuire concluded that ‘penal trajectories were determined by more
than just the will to reform’.132 My thesis is squarely based on this insight—that reform
proceeds in response to a range of conflicting pressures, some of which have little to do
with penal policy.


More than any other scholar, Mark Finnane has sought to address the silence regarding
the history of punishment in Australia. He is also one of the few in the field to link the
histories of the prison and the convict period, and to critique teleological interpretations
of prison history.133 He makes only passing references to prison farms in his work on the
subject, but he points the way towards plausible accounts of penal change. He asks:


        under what influences has imprisonment changed? The macro-historical answer
        to this question must be traced over centuries… But we can also examine a more
        local process, in which changes in institutions and practices take place at an
        observable level—and in which resistance to change and the limits of change
        become visible.134

The history that emerges from such an approach is, Finnane adds, a history ‘whose lines
do not travel in one direction, especially in the direction of progress’.135 This injunction to
observe the relationship between macro-historical processes and local specificities in
analysing penal change has heavily informed the present study.


Other writers, not necessarily historians, have investigated very particular aspects of the
history of imprisonment in Australia. Criminologists and legal academics have carried
out some useful work.136 J. E. Thomas and Alex Stewart supply a valuable section on the
history of Western Australia’s penal system in their 1978 work, which includes a short
discussion of Pardelup Prison Farm, the first prison farm in that state.137 The historical
sociologist, Jacqueline Z. Wilson has written movingly on escapes, graffiti in prisons, the
fate of individual prisoners and the ways in which sites of decommissioned prisons have
been transformed and remembered.138 The histories of a number of individual prisons
have been written, too. These contain many important snippets of information, but little
in the way of interpretation of penal change. Some of these accounts are commissioned
by departments of prisons/corrections, and others read like exercises in local civic
pride—the writers are clearly trying to put a historic landmark in their town ‘on the map’,
and the stories are therefore full of dogged perseverance and achievement, coloured with
local detail.139

Taken as a whole, the penal history of Australia, written by historians and others, is a
disjointed body of work, or as McGuire, put it ‘a fractured assortment’ lacking a long
view and bound to the limits of individual states.140 Many important topics await their
historian.141 No particular ‘schools of thought’ can be identified, but as far as the issue of
reform goes it may be said that if there is a pattern of interpretation, it is—despite the
efforts of Garton, McGuire and Finnane—that penal reform has been a teleological,
progressive process: a series of gradual, almost inevitable milestones on a road leading
from an unforgiving past to a more humanitarian present. However, as we shall see, this
interpretation cannot account for the emergence or the development of the Australian
prison camps.




The international literature


Although other countries have had their prison camp systems, the international literature
offers no models to test in the Australian context. Just as Australian historians have been
more attracted to transported convicts than to home-grown criminals, historians
everywhere, it seems, are more interested in grim-walled penitentiaries than prison
camps. As we shall see, however, works on the histories of other countries’ penal systems
are invaluable for understanding particular elements of the history of the Australian
camps.142

    The most glaring gap in the literature is the history of women’s imprisonment. Russell’s
Fairlea is a start, but much more work needs to be done on this topic; see Adrian Howe, Punish
and Critique: Towards a Feminist Analysis of Penality, Routledge, London and New York, 1994,
p. 156. Although minimum security institutions for women were established in the second half of
the twentieth century, the prison camps considered in this dissertation were for male prisoners
only. This is therefore a gendered history; it concerns men almost exclusively. This reflects the
starkly gendered nature of historical prison reform: women’s prisons have rarely attracted the
interest of reformers.
142
    The penal histories of Britain, the United States, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, France and
South Africa have been especially useful in this regard.

As in Australia, the dominant international narrative for many years emphasised
‘conscience as the motor of institutional change’, as Michael Ignatieff put it.143 In the
1960s and 1970s however, historians started ‘to question the heretofore accepted
explanation of the rise of the prison, an explanation stating that the prison, in comparison
with the gallows and the whipping post, represented a burgeoning spirit of benevolence
and humanitarianism.’144


Fruitful answers came from these questions. ‘The frozen landscape of the criminal justice
system,’ Adam J. Hirsch writes, ‘when glimpsed in the light of history, melts quickly;
conceptual continents drift, oceans of doctrine ebb and flow’.145 Gradually pictures
emerged of penal history ‘littered with unfulfilled promises, abandoned hopes, and
discarded institutions’.146 The thaw began with the work of three scholars in particular:
David J. Rothman, Michel Foucault and Michael Ignatieff.147 The details of the
revisionist and counter-revisionist historiography they set in train are only of tangential
relevance, and have been more than adequately covered elsewhere.148 For present
purposes, what is of interest in this historiography is a cluster of insights into the process
of penal change.


As many historians have pointed out, there is a peculiar contradiction in the way the
prison is commonly considered. The prison appears timeless. It is so firmly grounded in
the administrative landscape of modern society it is easy to assume it has held this
position for a great length of time. Yet, the prison is a modern invention. Imprisonment as

a primary punishment—rather than simply a way of holding an individual accused of
breaking a law until such time as his or her guilt or innocence has been
determined—dates back little more than two hundred years.


It is easy to make the mistake that there was something inevitable about the evolution of
the prison over the course of those two centuries. As Séan McConville observes, ‘the
passage of time confers its own legitimacy. Chronology, even in this bloodiest of all
centuries, is only too easily seen as progress’.149 It does not follow that the prison must be
a beneficent invention simply because it has replaced practices now regarded as barbaric,
such as hanging and flogging. As Rothman noted, in characterising the emergence of
prisons and asylums as ‘reforms,’ as many historians have done, we accept the arguments
of their creators at face value. There was nothing inescapable about the emergence and
evolution of the prison, and the dismal careers of these institutions should make the
historian ‘suspicious of any simple link’ between these institutions and the idea of
progress.150


While it is important to remove any assumption of inevitability from the history of penal
change, it is equally important avoid localising change in the hands of only a few
individuals. Patricia O’Brien, the author of a cogent history of French prisons, offers a
salutary reminder of this danger. The ‘often unavoidable result’ of this approach is, she
argued, ‘to centre on the good will and philanthropic impulses of the men and women
who devised new and just punishments’.151 This tends to obscure the historical
relationships of prisons to society, and also marginalises the voices and experiences of
prisoners and others involved in the penal system. O’Brien also insists that the reformers
have their place. To overlook their contributions and to focus exclusively on the broader
social forces driving penal change would be, she suggests ‘an error perhaps as great…
Instead of rejecting the role of reformers in the process of punishment, we must define
their place in it.’152


Other questions arise, once we suspend our belief in the idea of progress, and define the
role of reformers: what purposes does the prison serve, and how and why does it change?
A number of historians have seen ideologies of social control at the heart of the answers

to these questions. The prison presents itself as a response to crime, but it may also
perform other, unacknowledged functions. Several Marxist accounts emphasise the role
of the prison in managing surpluses in the labour market and instilling inmates with the
mode of time discipline required by a capitalist economy.153 This was largely the
argument of two pioneering but under-recognised scholars, Rusche and Kirchheimer. The
relationship they claimed between prisons and economics was perhaps a little crude, but
the principle from which they derived this relationship was quite sophisticated.
Punishment cannot be understood as a simple response to deviance. It is a much more
complex, and in some ways, independent phenomenon:


        The bond, transparent or not, that is supposed to exist between crime and
        punishment prevents any insight into the independent significance of the history
        of penal systems. It must be broken. Punishment is neither a simple consequence
        of crime, nor the reverse side of crime, nor a mere means which is determined by
        the end to be achieved. Punishment must be understood as a social
        phenomenon… We do not deny that punishment has its specific ends, but we do
        deny that it can be understood from its ends alone.154


Foucault developed Rusche and Kirchheimer’s analysis in his landmark work, Discipline
and Punish, agreeing that ‘we must … rid ourselves of the illusion that penality is above
all (if not exclusively) a means of reducing crime’.155 Prisons were developed by the state
as one of a number of institutions that changed the nature of governmental power, he
argued. Whereas the state once exercised power through exemplary spectacles against
individual subjects, following the rise of the modern prison, individuals themselves
became the state’s agents through their own self-discipline. The aim was ‘not to punish
less, but to punish better; to punish with an attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to
punish with more universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply
into the social body’.156


While his work has been enormously influential, there are a number limitations to
Foucault’s analysis. Perhaps the greatest is his assumption that disciplinary practice
accorded more or less exactly with disciplinary discourse. This assumption effectively

removes the prison from history. Rothman offered one of the most cogent critiques of
Foucault’s thesis, arguing that Foucault had simply substituted one form of inevitability
for another. Foucault’s prison, he suggested,


        assumes an inevitability in capitalist societies that makes reform at best
        foolhardy, at worst deceptive. But this approach is entirely static and thus
        misleading … prisons … do have a history that Foucault’s mode of analysis
        cannot illuminate… The more one understands the alterations within the system,
        the more one explores motives, designs, and alliances, the less an air of
        inevitability hangs over the practice of punishment and the less compelling
        arguments of economic determinism become… In Foucault’s world, the fit
        between a capitalist society and the prison is tight, as though rationality
        dominated throughout. In fact, the fit was much looser … and this gap is
        important … for getting the story straight … change is possible and may be
        significant without being total. There is much more room for manoeuvre than a
        Foucault could ever imagine or allow.157


The so-called ‘bond’ between crime and punishment can be complex without serving
totalitarian purposes. The counter-revisionist critiques that followed Foucault’s book,
including one written by Michael Ignatieff himself, adapted the ideas in the revisionist
literature to suggest more complicated models of penal practice and change, showing that
‘modernity is the site of a recurring battle between rationalizing intention and institutions,
interests and communities which resist, often with persistent success’.158 Accordingly:


        Instead of looking for some hidden function which prisons actually succeed in
        discharging, we ought to work free of such functionalist assumptions altogether
        and begin to think of society in much more dynamic and historical terms, as
        being ordered by institutions like the prisons which fail their constituencies and
        which limp along because no alternative can be found or because conflict over
        alternatives is too great to be mediated into compromise.159

I have found Rothman’s, Pratt’s and Ignatieff’s later remarks very useful in
understanding the history of the Australian prison camps; Foucault’s less so. It is not that
ideologies do not shape penal institutions—they most certainly do, but it is a partial
shaping. Competing ideologies and interests, pragmatism, and the sheer inertia of
bureaucracy also play significant roles. In the absence of an elevated role for individual
reformers, or for the abstraction of progress, the ‘challenge of historical analysis’160
forces us to construct explanations in which both the causes and the directions of change
are many, and often contradictory. These explanations must, moreover, look well beyond
the prison itself. As David Garland argues, ‘penal institutions are functionally,
historically, and ideologically conditioned by numerous other social relations and
agencies, which are, in turn, supported and conditioned by the operation of penal
institutions.’161


If we abandon humanitarianism as an all-dominant principle, this does not mean that we
must shy to the opposite extreme, and attribute all change to the modern state’s powerful
appetite for control over its citizens. Both these forces are entangled in penal reform, and
have created complicated, compromised institutions that are not easily understood. As
John Pratt argues:


         Penal systems would seem to be the product of incremental growth and
         refurbishment. Punishment ideologies may be mutually exclusive but, as far as
         their strategic impact is concerned, they are likely to be welded on to an already
         existing structure … a compromise then has to be mediated with what remains.162


Such are the gleanings from the historiography that have informed my approach to penal
history generally. Although they do not provide a model for the investigation of the
Australian prison camps, they do offer a way of looking at the subject, and, perhaps most
useful of all, a guide to the questions that need to be answered. Rothman framed them
thus:


         How does each generation arrive at its reform program? What elements come
         together to earn a proposed innovation the title of reform. Who makes up the

            cadre of reformers? Perhaps even more important, where do they find their
            constituents? How do their programs win enactment? And then a second order of
            questions emerges: what difference do the programs make? How consistently are
            they translated into practice? Put more forcefully, why is it that reforms so often
            turn out to be in need of reform?163


The next chapter begins the task answering Rothman’s questions—of explicating the
camps as an exercise in penal change. Prisons have a past and they have a future, but they
also have an imagined future and an imagined past. These imaginings have had
significant impacts on penal reform in the early twentieth century in general, and on the
camps in particular.


The material legacy of the past also has to be considered. Chapter three teases out some
of the ways in which the camps were a response to problems with the penal architecture
created by earlier generations of reformers.


Penal history is related to labour history, and the origins of the camp movement had
much to do with the politics and culture of prison labour, as chapter four shows.


Penal history is also related to environmental history, and there is a powerful link
between the penology on which the camps were based and ways of thinking about
landscape and redemption. Prisons are in and of places, after all. They have
environmental presences: no landscape remains the same when a prison is built upon it.
Obviously, this is particularly true when the prison happens to be attached to a farm or a
plantation, and in fact these changes are linked. As an exercise of prison reform, the
camps cannot be understood without analysing the relationship between reform and the
environment; chapter five offers such an analysis.164


The camps not only provide ways to articulate the dynamics of penal reform, they also
form a case study through which to reconsider the ways that changes in penal systems can
be evaluated. Reform has, for the most part, been measured in simple, quantitative
measures, such as reconviction rates, financial expense, and rates of escape. But there are
other ways to think about success or failure in penal systems. Chapter six is a qualitative
investigation of the theory and practice of rehabilitation from a historical perspective, and

163

164
      Chapters six and seven also touch on these issues.

                                                    37

it offers insights into the value and meaning of reform that statistical analyses of
recidivism, useful as they are, never can. Likewise, detailed biographies of particular
prisoners—such as that offered in chapter seven—can illuminate the effects of
imprisonment on the life-course of the ex-prisoner. This is a point of view that prisoner
files, with all their reports from superintendents, parole officers and psychologists, cannot
offer.


Escapes are always an acute concern for penal administrators, and occur particularly
frequently in those with lowered security. They are uniformly seen by the public and the
media as system failures or scandals, but escapes too can be reconsidered, as chapter
eight shows. Indeed, the history of escapes from prison farms suggests that a certain rate
of escape may even be essential in a successful prison system.


The missing figure in most penal reform discourse is the guard. Historians have, for the
most part, de-humanised and de-historicised prison officers. However, the effects of
reform on prison guards are of vital importance, and vice versa. Chapter nine shows that
prison camps provide a useful lens through which to observe the connections between
prison reform and prison work. The camps also show that guards, often maligned as
obstacles to reform and stereotyped as sadists, have in fact acted as vectors for change.


This thesis concludes with a brief reflection on penal history and contemporary
correctional policy, based on the history of the camps.

         Prison Camps, Progressive Penology and the
                                   Convict Taint



At first glance the spread and development of the prison camps appears to be part of a
familiar narrative of institutional and social improvement. Conditions at camp seemed a
distinct advance on those in conventional prisons. Prisoners were known by name not by
number. Their food was generally better than they had known before. They earned more
remission. The work was healthier, the air fresher, the light better. They were less likely
to be abused or assaulted by other prisoners or guards. They were permitted privileges
such as fishing and swimming. They were allowed visits from local musical, sporting and
religious groups. They wore modified uniforms and, at some camps, could dress in
civilian clothes. All these measures fitted easily into a discourse of reason, progress, and
humanity, which was in turn reinforced by low recidivism rates. Prison reform appeared
to be marching into a bright new future.


The camps were connected to the progressive reform agenda, and they were linked with
some of the most important developments in twentieth century penology. But they cannot
be understood without also examining the effects of the past—real and imagined—on
prison reform discourse and practice.




PROGRESSIVISM AND PENOLOGY


According to Michael Roe, in the aftermath of the traumatic depression of the early
1890s, there was in Australia a pervasive sense that the state must play a more active role
in social and economic affairs, and liberate society’s ‘unused energies’. There was, Roe
argued, ‘a general consensus that … the restoration of virtue must come through the body
politic’.1 Prisons offered perhaps the fullest expression of this article of faith. No other
institution offered such scope for the elimination of waste and obsolete tradition and the

maximisation of human potential. In almost no other field did the state have such
seemingly complete control over its subjects.


Progressivism is the term commonly applied to a movement that emerged in the late
nineteenth century and blossomed in the early twentieth century. Progressives believed in
and advocated the incremental state-led improvement of society by rational means. Such
progress was seen as an inevitable: the past was bound to give way to a better future. Any
impediments to this process were only temporary interruptions, rather than stable
realities.


Prison reform was a subject of great interest for progressives around the world, and
enlightened penal policy was understood as a marker of a civilised society. As Winston
Churchill famously stated in 1910:


         The mood and temper of the public with regard to the treatment of crime and
         criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country … a
         desire and an eagerness to rehabilitate in the world of industry those who have
         paid their due in the hard coinage of punishment; tireless efforts towards the
         discovery of curative and regenerative processes; unfailing faith that there is a
         treasure, if you can only find it, in the heart of every man. These are the symbols,
         which … mark and measure the stored up strength of a nation, and are sign and
         proof of the living virtue in it.2


It is no surprise then that leading figures of Australian progressivism, such as the feminist
Rose Scott and the radical clergyman Charles Strong were involved in the prison reform
movement and deeply interested in criminological matters. Those charged with the
administration of the prisons were also strongly attracted to the tenets of progressivism.3
In 1916, George F. Smith was a young officer in the NSW Prisons Department. Naming
inebriety as one of the ‘great evils’ which would have to be conquered ‘before much
progress is made toward a higher civilization’, Smith (who went on to lead a long and
successful career in the Prisons Department) asked if the inebriate was

Victoria was home to some of the most passionate adherents of progressive penology.
Samuel Mauger was the chairman of the Victorian Indeterminate Sentences Board (ISB)
from 1912 until his death in 1936.5 While Victoria’s early camps were staffed and
maintained by the Department of Penal Establishments, Gaols and Reformatory Prisons,
the ISB was responsible for overseeing camp operations. Until 1956 all inmates at the
McLeod Settlement were under indeterminate sentences, and the release of such prisoners
was entirely at the board’s discretion.6


Mauger played an important role in several progressive causes, and he was also the
architect of the prison camp movement in Victoria.7 In a speech given in Warnambool in
March 1924 he illustrated his faith and hope in a world governed by reason. Above the
door to the classification committee’s room at Sing Sing Prison in New York, Mauger
said, was a plaque inscribed with three words: ‘science—charity—thrift’. These, he said
were ‘the key words of the new movement to better prison conditions’. The previous
generation only prayed for better things, while the current generation, Mauger felt, could
answer those prayers.8 He told his audience that the words of the Persian poet, Omar
Khayyam, found an ‘echo’ in his heart:


        Ah love, could you and I with him conspire,

For progressives like Mauger, there was little doubt that the state had such power.
Around the world, prison populations shrank dramatically during the first decades of the
twentieth century, and administrators were quick to interpret this as proof of the efficacy
of their reforms.11
The farms and camps seemed a testimony to the increasing influence of humanity’s better
angels. Shortly after the Emu Plains Prison Farm opened, a local correspondent wondered
how, at the same time Europe tore itself to shreds, efforts were underway


        to harmonise or perhaps we should say modernise, and frame in kindlier grooves,
        the methods of governing applied to those adjudged to be offenders against the
        laws of the State and society … the aim of the Prison Department is remedial in a
        truly benevolent sense, and shows how far the modern Democratic spirit has
        suffused the progressive ideas of the capable officers at the head of the State’s
        social corrective system; and how far we have left behind the baleful methods of
        the past … it is an experiment the success of which all true humanists the world
        over will hail with pleasure.12


In May 1918, The Daily Examiner called the Tuncurry camp ‘a triumphant vindication of
a humane and reformative prison system’. It went on to say:


        each effort to wipe out the eye-for-an-eye and tooth-for-a-tooth form of
        punishment, replacing it by a system of temporising justice not with vengeance,
        but with humanity and mercy, has been to the credit and the welfare of the
        State.13


Four years later, a correspondent for The Newcastle Herald also saw modern wisdom on
the north coast’s sand-dunes. ‘No longer is it the fashion to treat or speak of the law
breaker from the point of view merely of punishment’, he wrote.


        Those who think at all deeply on the question know that the confinee is very
        often in need of treatment for mental health rather than for anything else … the

        methods employed [at Tuncurry] would fill the old-time penal disciplinarian with
        dismay, but they are eminently sane and practical all the same.14


The radical clergyman Charles Strong, after visiting the McLeod Settlement in the early
1920s, said it was


        an Institution of which Victoria, indeed Australia, may be proud… The
        Settlement is the outcome of the New Penology, which strives to treat the
        prisoner as a man, and to reform and restore to good citizenship, rather than to
        retaliate and crush.15


Many perceived something inevitable about gradual improvement. ‘Decade followed
decade, and punishment became more moderate’ one observer of the NSW prison system
wrote in 1935, citing the decline in the state’s rate of incarceration.


        A realization of the intensity of suffering which human beings had to bear
        became more general… To-day it is a revelation to look behind the scenes at how
        the modern prisons are run … we have seen how cruelty, severity, and injustice
        have given place to kindness, sympathy, and justice.16


One columnist, after visiting Emu Plains in 1941, remarked that though the farm ‘was
actually here in the present, it belonged to the better future’.17


Such observations were not restricted to NSW. Similar language attended the early
operations of most prison camps in this period, across the country. When Pardelup Prison
Farm opened in June 1927, The West Australian said the move was: ‘in keeping with
modern movements of prison reform’, adding that ‘humane and intelligent’ principles
were steadily replacing the ‘barbaric’ practices of the past.18 Only a few months after the

opening of the Kilderry Gaol Farm, The Mercury declared that the farm presented ‘a
lesson in what is possible in regard to the rehabilitation of men’s characters under a
modern prison system’.19 In July 1938, the announcement of the opening of the
Cooriemungle Prison Camp in Victoria, still drew out the language of progress. It was,
according to The Age, ‘another stage in the welcome process of prison reform …
welcome not only as a businesslike enterprise but as contributing to the noble process of
human salvage’.20 The same year, T h e Herald declared the McLeod Settlement
represented ‘the longest step towards a civilised prison system that Victoria, and even
Australia, has yet attempted’.21 Late in his career, the Queensland CGP James Whitney
reflected:


        For many years it has been apparent to all criminologists and others who have
        witnessed and experienced the harsher methods of prison discipline that such
        treatment of unfortunates committed to prison was not conducive to the ultimate
        reformation of the prisoner… The Government … has seen fit to institute from
        time to time progressive reforms and more humane methods of prison treatment,
        culminating with the major reform in 1934 of the introduction of the ‘Prison
        Farm System’.22


Even those unconvinced of the benevolence claimed for the prisons knew the rhetorical
power of the language of progressivism. ‘The people of this great nation’, wrote a former
prisoner, ‘who boast of their freedom from tyranny, their glorious principles of justice
and fair play, their splendid march along the road to a perfect state of civilization should
know what is done to the friendless in their name’.23

The camps were not only in tune with the general spirit of the times; they were a vehicle
for some of the signature reforms of progressive penology.


The principle of ‘less eligibility’ was central to late-nineteenth-century prison
management. It required that conditions in prison be worse than those in which the
poorest free workers lived. Theorists held that if prison life were seen to be easier than
life outside, the prison would lose its power as a deterrent, and those at the bottom of the
industrial ladder would choose imprisonment over freedom. The principle operated more
powerfully in Britain than in Australia, but no prison administration was immune to it.
Progressive penology emphasised the rehabilitation of the offender over deterrence and
was therefore incompatible with the principle; nowhere was this fact more visible than at
the camps. Life was certainly easier in some ways for many inmates at camps than it was
for impoverished free citizens, particularly during difficult economic times. Indeed,
during the Great Depression of the early 1930s. camp inmates fared substantially better
than unemployed workers at relief camps, much to the chagrin of the jobless.24


The camps also represented a modification of a penological axiom: certainty in
punishment. Classical penologists, like Cesare Becarria had sought ways to ensure penal
equity—the punishment was to fit the crime. This required a rational gradient of
punishment, whereby crimes of different degrees could be differentiated by their
punishments. As financial penalties affected individuals differently depending on their
wealth, fixed fines were an unequal punishment. Imprisonment initially appeared to be
the perfect remedy to this dilemma. Time, since it was almost infinitely divisible, was the
ideal medium for a rational gradient. Each crime could, in theory, carry its own particular
punishment in a proportionate scale, with a fixed, logical relationship between the crime
and its consequence.25


The Victorian Inspector General William Callaway was one of the early advocates of
prison farms in Victoria, and he explicitly rejected classical penology’s emphases on
certainty and proportionality. No matter how carefully calibrated the structure of
sentences, imprisonment affected people differently. Some were crushed by a six-month
stint, others did years relatively unscathed. Callaway thought human affairs could not be
weighed and compared with sufficient exactitude. ‘Science has not yet devised an

instrument to make the punishment fit the crime’, he said. In any case, he thought prisons
should concern themselves with improving the prisoner rather than seeking to give effect
to an impossible calculus, and, in Callaway’s opinion, there were few tools better suited
to the task of improving criminals than the prison camps.26


The camps, with their improved conditions and lowered security, were intended for good
conduct prisoners. This seemingly minor detail actually represented the modification of
another major principle of classical penology. Nineteenth century prisons relied heavily
on classification schemes. These largely turned on the number of convictions recorded
against a prisoner’s name. First offenders were separated from those with two
convictions, and so on. The problem with such classifications was that the number of
convictions a prisoner had reflected the degree of their ‘criminality’ very poorly. The
professional thief, caught for the first time after years of offending, was, for instance,
lumped together with the bigamist who had committed no other crime. These
classifications were based, moreover, on the behaviour of the offender before he or she
came to prison. In 1924 the Superintendent of Hobart Prison described this system as
antiquated: ‘it avoids consideration of the most important factor of all—the individual
himself’.27


Candidates for transfer to the camps were selected, in part, on the basis of good conduct
and industry in prison. Once at camp, prisoners were eligible for more remission than
prisoners in closed prisons. Or, if they were under indeterminate sentences, the date of
their release was conditional on their behaviour. Thus, the nature and the duration of a
prisoner’s imprisonment was determined, to an extent, by their behaviour after their
offence. This shift in focus from the crime to criminal represented, as John Pratt wrote in
relation to the development of the New Zealand camp system, ‘an altogether different
economy of punishment’.28 Prison camps allowed prisoners’ character, their will and
ability to reform to influence the nature and duration of their punishment. Of course, it
was prison officials, not judges, who were in a position to assess prisoners’ will and
character. Thus the camps also facilitated a process described by Pratt as ‘a creeping shift

of the power to punish’ from the judiciary to the executive, itself a defining feature of
twentieth century penology.29


The press applauded the seemingly more scientific emphasis on the prisoner’s needs and
characteristics. The Sydney Morning Herald insisted that the ‘classification of individuals
must replace the old one of crime’.30 Prisons, The Age declared in 1925, were to become
clinics: ‘concerned, not with crime, but with the criminal’.31


Uniformity of treatment was eroded by the camps in other ways which were not publicly
acknowledged. As remote settlements, the camps required prisoners with certain skills,
particularly in their first few years of operation. Any modestly well-behaved prisoner
who knew how to erect a sturdy A-frame, cook a passable meal, or intelligently handle
livestock, could expect to have his application for transfer to a camp looked upon
favourably, or even have such a transfer suggested to him. Thus it was also the needs of
the prison itself which came to compromise the principle of certainty.32 In practice, the
older principles of classical penology continued to influence the treatment of prisoners,
but nevertheless penological theory had reached a significant turning-point.




Progressive penology and the medical metaphor


For progressives, the imprimatur of science was a mark of authority. Prison
administrators cloaked their increasing power over the punishment of prisoners in
scientific terms, particularly those borrowed from medicine. This gave the new penology
an air of impartial credibility and mitigated the impression that the punishment was
becoming subject to arbitrary executive authority. As Rothman notes, it also permitted
administrators ‘an unprecedented latitude of action’.33


In the early twentieth century, criminology was only just cementing its status as a
professional discipline. Like their colleagues in the other emerging humanistic
disciplines, such as psychology and anthropology, criminologists and penologists were

very concerned to establish the legitimacy and credentials of their craft. ‘Penology may
be defined as the science of the protection of society from crime by the repression,
reformation, and extirpation of criminals’, wrote Henry Boiles, author of one the leading
penological texts of the day.34


More than any other field of science, medicine offered evidence of progressivism’s
precepts, and reformers in other fields borrowed heavily from the language of modern
diagnostics. Penologists and administrators found this language particularly useful, as
Michel Foucault has demonstrated.35 Criminality was characterised as a moral disease,
and susceptible to treatment just like physical ailments. By the start of the twentieth
century, following advances in epidemiology and public health, penologists imagined the
elimination of the ‘disease’ itself. Boiles thought crime just one of many ‘once incurable
and terrible diseases’ that would one day be added to the list of maladies tamed by
science, including ‘smallpox, cholera, yellow and typhoid fevers, diphtheria, and
tuberculosis’.36


The concept of crime as a moral illness entered Australian penology in 1896 with the
appointment of Frederic Neitenstein as the CGP in NSW, a post he held until 1909. A
regular correspondent with international experts, Neitenstein was arguably the most
important conduit for criminological ideas in the colonies. His ‘authority in
criminological opinion and penal administration was unchallenged in Australia.37 He was
familiar with the work of Boiles and other international penologists.38 In his first report,
Neitenstein characterised the ‘prison as a hospital for the treatment of moral diseases’.
They were, he admitted, rather unsuccessful as such, but ‘Criminal therapeutics have
special difficulties to encounter’. Prison officials, unlike doctors, could not prescribe the
length of the patient’s treatment. That was fixed by the courts and the prison officials

much further. Plato described the criminal as a sick man, whose recovery must be a public
concern; see Pratt, Punishment in a Perfect Society, pp171-72; and Torsten Eriksson, The

were forced to release their charges back into the community at the end of the term
imposed by the judge, regardless of whether a cure had been effected. Prisons, moreover,
were forced to treat cases beyond their specialty. Into prison rolled the drunk, the insane,
the vagrant and the defaulter. None of them could rightly be described as suffering from
the kind of ailment that plagued the rapist, the thief and the murderer. Prisons,
Neitenstein maintained, could only function as effective hospitals for the treatment of the
disease of crime.39 Medicine and penology, in the words of Bashford and Strange,
‘dovetailed as tactics to define and manage problem populations’.40


Medical language took root in penal discourse around the country, appearing frequently
in the press and in official documents. ‘It is obvious’ wrote a special correspondent in the
Sydney Morning Herald in 1923,


        that the old statutes and codes were, generally speaking, drawn up before
        preventive medicine and psychology had developed the facts with regard to the
        causes and possible treatment of crime and delinquency.41


The Queensland CGP William Pennefather felt the objective of punishment was not to
bring about a moral transformation in the offender, but to cure an illness, and the prison
was to become, in words he borrowed from Neitenstein, ‘a hospital for the treatment of
moral diseases’.42 In Western Australia, the Justice Minister Thomas Walker cited a
passage from Morrison’s ‘Crime and its Causes’: ‘The will is stricken with disease and
the man is dashed hither and thither, a helpless wreck on the sea of Life’.43 John Drew
himself offered a variation on the theme, figuring crime as an illness of the body politic,
rather than the individual criminal. ‘If the nation is to be great’ he wrote, before he

November 1924. Only a few months after Mauger gave his speech, the Superintendent of Hobart
Gaol wrote to his Attorney General, insisting ‘if the nation is to be truly great, there must be…an
advancement which aims at the social uplifting of its people, which seeks out the causes of moral
and physical degradation, and removes the social ulcer in whatsoever form it appears’. ‘Report on

established the Pardelup Prison Farm, it is necessary to seek out ‘the causes of moral and
physical degradation’ and to remove ‘the social ulcer in whatever form it is discovered’.44


A few penologists carried the metaphor to fanciful extremes. Writing in the Sydney
Morning Herald for instance, one would-be reformer imagined the prison of the future, in
which ‘walls, cells and bars would be replaced by attractive, hospital like buildings, and
the armed guards by nurses’.45 Although overblown, such language reflected the
increasing authority of the social scientist. The cult of the expert and the metaphor of the
hospital led to the further distancing of the public from the punishment of crime—their
interest could be cast as distasteful and unhelpful.


Prison camps were seen as the precursors of the criminal clinics of the future. Even in
1927, thought Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, ‘one might be pardoned for mistaking the
Prison Farm’ at Emu Plains ‘for a species of sanatorium’ for the benefit of ‘jaded, nerve-
wracked city folk’.46 Another observer remarked on the ‘crime sanatorium’ at Tuncurry,
‘unknown to most people’ but ‘where offenders are “treated”’ rather than punished:


        This exotic domain represents the last word in the treatment of those social
        invalids who are suffering from one of the many phases of what Bernard Shaw
        calls the disease of crime.47




The indeterminate sentence


Prison camps appear part and parcel of the modern progressive prison reform agenda in
part because they were closely associated with a key penological innovation of the
time—the indeterminate sentence. Although there were a number of variations on the
idea, the fundamental principle was that through imprisonment, under the right
circumstances, the ‘criminality’ that led a person to prison could be erased. However, as
with recovery from illness, the length of the convalescence varied from patient to patient.
Following this logic to its conclusion, proponents of the indeterminate sentence felt that

the duration of the sentence should be unfixed, and that the prisoner should be released
only when the penal authorities were satisfied of his or her ‘cure’.48


Penologists such as Henry Boiles argued that if crime were akin to illness, then fixed time
sentences were ‘as irrational as the employment of a doctor for a serious ailment on a
time contract’.49 No self-respecting doctor would accept the instructions of a non-
specialist in determining when a patient was fit for discharge from the hospital, and those
who favoured the indeterminate sentence failed to see why prison officials should let
themselves be told when to discharge their ‘patients’. Many administrators and
penologists felt that, under a truly scientific criminal justice system, all sentences would
be indeterminate.50


The indeterminate sentence was developed first in England by Frederic Hill and his
brother, Matthew Davenport Hill, and first implemented by the famous American
penologist, Zebulon Brockway in the 1870s. Thereafter it was exported to Australia and
New Zealand, where it remained a popular concept until well into the second half of the
twentieth century.51 In the words of one of its historians, it was ‘associated with a
reformist, progressive, liberal or enlightened position on crime and corrections for about a
century’.52


Although most Australian prison systems at least flirted with the use of the indeterminate
sentence, it was in Victoria, the state most receptive to American innovations, that it was
most extensively used. William Callaway, the Inspector General of Prisons in the early
years of the twentieth century was a strong supporter. Admitting that the prospect was


48
   The indeterminate sentence should not be confused with the indefinite sentence commonly
applied in the United States, where the sentencing judge specifies minimum and maximum periods
of time to be served by the prisoner.

   Enthusiasm for the indeterminate sentence ran higher in the United States than in Britain. The

which is vague and arbitrary’. Tallack, Penological and Preventative Principles, Wertheimer, Lea
& Co., London, 1896, p. 193. See also Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, ‘An English View of the American

and every sentence were indeterminate discharge being a guarantee of cure, there would
be solid grounds for public confidence’.53 Callaway went on:


        The fundamental principle is not that the punishment should fit the crime but that
        it should fit the criminal. He is imprisoned not for what he did but for what he
        was. The indeterminate sentence says to him ‘you are imprisoned because your
        violation of the law has shown that you are unfit to be free’.54


The Victorian ISB was established by legislation in 1907. Described as ‘the first major
change in the sentencing structure’ of the state, the sentence remained on the Victorian
law books until 1956.55 Sentencing regimes in most Australian jurisdictions provided for
a prisoner to be liable for an indeterminate sentence only after a number of previous
convictions of a certain severity within a specified time. In some states, a prisoner could
only be subject to an indeterminate sentence after the court had declared him or her to be
a habitual criminal. The law in Victoria went further. It permitted a judge to impose an
indeterminate sentence upon the first conviction. By subjecting criminals to reformatory
treatment at the first possible opportunity, it was hoped to reduce the rate of recidivism
and the ranks of habitual criminals. Victoria’s indeterminate sentence regime was, by
virtue of this provision, one of the most extreme in the world, a fact in which the ISB
took some pride. In 1910, Charles Topp, the board’s first chairman, having recently
inspected penal regimes around the world, said: ‘In no other country which I visited has
the indeterminate sentence been given so extended an operation as under our law’.56
Fourteen years later, the board felt that the indeterminate sentence was ‘the foundation of
the rational treatment of a criminal’.57 In 1925, in response to criticisms made in the
press, Mauger declared: ‘The habitual fears it, denounces it as un-British, and adversely

criticises those who administer it. He finds, however, that there is only one road to
freedom’.58


For many prisoners in Victoria, the road to freedom, such as it was, passed through the
McLeod Settlement. Prior to the establishment of the camp on French Island in 1916, the
ISB had agitated for some time for a camp along the lines of that at Tuncurry. Indeed,
members of the board did not feel that their work was properly begun until the purchase
of the French Island property.59 The ISB saw the indeterminate sentence and the
reformatory prison as important, linked elements of a modern penal system, ‘the
outstanding features of our prison system to-day’.60 The entire first contingent sent to
French Island were indeterminate sentence men, and for much of the camp’s history, it
was reserved for such prisoners. The American penologist, Robert H. Gault, thought
prison farms ‘the necessary complement to the plan of indeterminate sentence’.61


Other states experimented with the indeterminate sentence. The Western Australian
Prisons Act 1918, was largely modeled on the Victorian system, and the same legislation
provided for the establishment of both reformatory prison farms and an Indeterminate
Sentences Board. Many of the prisoners held at Pardelup Prison Farm were under
indeterminate sentences.62


In 1924 the Superintendent of Hobart Gaol called for the establishment of a prison farm,
so that the indeterminate sentence, which was already on the state’s law books, could be
properly applied.63 In 1936, Controller Mullen praised the sentence (despite the fact that
there were only seven individuals serving one), saying it forced the prisoner ‘to work out

his own salvation’.64 Mullen thought that only at a prison farm could such prisoners get
‘the treatment designed by the Act’. By the time the farm at Hayes was finally established
there were only three prisoners under indeterminate sentences in Tasmania.65 But the
sentence remained on Tasmania’s law books until the 1970s. Ironically, when it was
finally abolished it was described as ‘archaic’ and ‘out of touch with the supposedly
enlightened age’.66


In NSW, Neitenstein was greatly impressed by the indeterminate sentence.67 At his
urging, Parliament passed legislation enabling the sentence, but it was infrequently
applied by the courts.68 Undeterred, Neitenstein admitted that there was ‘much in all this
to shock established habit and long custom, but that the new idea is making headway is
certain’.69


Ultimately, the indeterminate sentence failed to make much headway outside Victoria,
but in practice, wherever it was implemented, administrators felt that prison camps were
the logical place to confine prisoners subject to it.


The prisoners themselves were of course, not so sure. In 1924, Smith’s Weekly reported
that Victorian inmates likened an indeterminate sentence to ‘a greasy pole’; one could
laboriously climb to the top, only to be pushed back to the bottom again.70 Many
prisoners preferred to think of their sentences as ‘debts’ of certain fixed values that were
‘paid off’ by time in prison. Inspector General Akeroyd felt the average criminal thought
little of a fixed one year sentence, and would ‘take such a risk cheerfully’. The
indeterminate sentence was a ‘different matter’, and it was no coincidence as far as

    In 1924, with his final report, Urquhart called for a ‘more general application’ of the
indeterminate sentence, and in 1926, the NSW CGP George Steele was still calling for more
widespread use of the sentence in his state. Referring to a resolution at a recent international
congress of prison administrators, he stated that the indeterminate sentence was a vital tool in the
‘struggle against recidivism’ and that it was ‘the necessary consequence of the individualization of
punishment, and one of the most efficacious means of social defence’; see Report of the
Comptroller-General of Prisons, New South Wales for the Year 1925-26, Government Printer,

Akeroyd was concerned that ‘the great bulk of would-be prison reformers’ turned out to
be prisoners who had served indeterminate sentences, and that their main aim was to
abolish the sentence.71


The ways prisoners referred to the indeterminate sentence are revealing. To many, it was
known simply as ‘the key’. In describing it thus, prisoners parodied the official
explanation of the sentence. While theoretically the sentence placed the key to freedom in
the prisoner’s hands, the term also reflected the inmates’ belief that the indeterminate
sentence was a locked cage to which the key had been thrown away.72 Either way, a
prisoner had no way of knowing when he or she might be released, and that was the
greatest hardship of the sentence.


Inmates at the McLeod Settlement and the Castlemaine prison farm during the 1920s,
sometimes referred to the sentence as ‘Kathleen Mavourneen’, after the famous
nineteenth-century song of parting:


         It may be for years, and it may be forever,
         Oh! why art thou silent thou voice of my heart?
         It may be for years, and it may be forever,
         Then why art thou silent Kathleen Mavourneen?73


In September 1921, The Argus reported that ‘Kathleen’ irked the young prisoners at
McLeod and Castlemaine, but older prisoners, who were familiar with life in Pentridge
hailed her ‘as a blessing’.74 The relatives of offenders who received indeterminate
sentences were not so sanguine. In 1929, four young men were sentenced in Melbourne

   Composed by the British musician, Frederick Nichols Crouch in 1837, the song became popular
in the United States, and later became the inspiration for a controversial motion picture. See

   Ibid. Not all of those under ‘the key’ made it to McLeod or Castlemaine though. Some remained
stuck in Pentridge Prison, others were released only to return. John Dihm began service as a guard
at Pentridge in 1937. Later, he recalled ‘it was nothing for a man to do three or four keys running:
out, in, out, in. It was hopeless yet a lot of these blokes were good blokes. Some of them started as
boy keys’. See Broome, Richard, Coburg: Between Two Creeks, Coburg Historical Society,
Melbourne, 2001, p. 270. For another, later, prisoner’s perspective on the indeterminate sentence,
see Leslie Newcombe, Inside Out: The True Story of the Simmonds-Newcombe Gaol Escape,
Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1979, p. 154.

on charges of larceny. Two of the men, who had prior convictions, were handed
indeterminate sentences. When the mother of one heard Judge Woinarski say he intended
to send them to Castlemaine or McLeod, she stood up and declared ‘You will not send
him’. Then running towards the bench, she cried ‘Do not take him away from me, do not
send my boy away. He is my support’.75 But Woinarski was an enthusiast for the
sentence, and was unmoved. In 1924, after a former inmate from McLeod was brought up
on new charges before him, Woinarski had complained ‘The worst of French Island is
that men are allowed to leave there too soon’.76


Frank Posselt took up service as the Education Officer at the McLeod Settlement in 1955,
just before indeterminate sentences were abolished. He saw little sign of science, or of
reform. The inmates were unkempt, unshaven and wore tattered old football jumpers.
They were uninterested in the work and thoroughly depressed. Many served sentences of
lengths wildly disproportionate to the offence of which they had been convicted. The
possibility of corruption or arbitrariness on the part of officials was ever-present, and
prisoners under the sentence were even more dependent on the goodwill and favour of
their captors than prisoners with fixed sentences. When the board refused to promote a
prisoner to a higher grade, or grant his release, Posselt said, ‘they’d be absolutely
seething… I’ve seen them go absolutely bonkers’. After the sentence was done away with
the following year, Posselt saw things change at McLeod:


        They shaved regularly each day, they’d wear their work clothes during the day
        and come 4 or 5 when they finished work, they’d shower and get into their cell
        clothing … they started to take an interest in themselves whereas before, they felt
        nothing.77


‘The rehabilitative dream of the indeterminate sentence’ turned out, as Arie Freiberg and
David Biles write, ‘to be something of a penological nightmare’. The medical metaphor
‘completely ignored the socio-political nature of crime and its relation to society’, and the
deleterious psychological effect of indeterminate detention on inmates.78 As the historian

of the Canadian penal system, Joseph Berkovits writes: ‘Thanks to metaphors, the
language of rehabilitation could be beautiful, but the reality was not’.79




THE LEGACY OF FREDERIC NEITENSTEIN


The camps’ reputation as a quintessentially progressive reform derives, partly, from their
mis-association with Frederic Neitenstein. Once the relationship between Neitenstein’s
ideas and the camp movement is clarified, the effects of the imagined past and future on
prison reform discourse becomes more readily apparent.


Neitenstein’s reputation in his time was a shining one, and so it remains today. Many
have seen him as the complete bureaucrat. Diane Payne called him ‘persistent,
humanitarian, eclectic and pre-eminently sensible’. He was so devoted to his work that
when questioned about his recreations, he listed ‘reform and philanthropy’.80 His
reputation and authority on these matters derived in large part from the remarkable drop
in the NSW prison population during his term at helm of the NSW Prisons Department.81
Of the comptrollers who succeeded him, John Ramsland claimed, ‘none were as
impressive as Neitenstein’, although Ramsland conceded that none of the others shared
Neitenstein’s opportunities in working during the ‘the golden years of social
reconstruction that marked out Australia as the most progressive democracy in the world
in the first decade of the 20th century’.82 Neitenstein has also been credited as the ‘man

PhD Thesis, University of Toronto, 2000, p. 81. By the second half of the twentieth century,
medical analogies were increasingly seen as quaint markers of an out-dated penology. In 1968, for
instance, Norval Morris stated that ‘the analogy between the doctor’s “treatment” and the court’s
or penal administrator’s “treatment” is imperfect. The subject of medical diagnosis is better
defined than is the social disease of crime, and in the former the patient consents to treatment
while the criminal does not’. See Morris, ‘Prison in Evolution’, Seminar on Prisons and the
Treatment of Adult Offenders with Special Reference to South Australia, University of Adelaide,
Adelaide, 1968, p. 34. See also Norval Morris and David J. Rothman, ‘Introduction’ in Morris and

   Ramsland argued that the drop of 632 in the prison population over the twenty years prior to
1916 ‘demonstrates the success of Neitenstein’s reforms in achieving modernisation of the New
South Wales prison system’. See: With Just But Relentless Discipline: A Social History of
Corrective Services in New South Wales, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, 1996, p. 186.

who removed the convict taint from the prisons of New South Wales’.83 In July 1930, the
NSW Minister for Justice, John R. Lee told the Howard Prison Reform League:
‘Probably, in the whole of the annals of the Public Service of this State there was never
an appointment more justified than his’.84


Changes instituted by Neitenstein in the regime of prison labour have been interpreted to
suggest that the camps were an extrapolation of his principles. Immediately upon
assuming control of the NSW Prisons Department, Neitenstein instructed the governors
to put any spare land attached to their gaols under cultivation by prison labour. In his first
annual report as Comptroller-General, he wrote:


         A new departure was made during the latter part of the year in putting under
         cultivation such of the spare grounds as were attached to the gaol establishments.
         So far this has met with much success. The work is not only healthy and active
         for the prisoners, but is likely to effect some saving in the cost of provisions, as
         many gaols can now grow all their own vegetables.85


Some of the characteristics of the camps can be perceived in Neitenstein’s agricultural
labour program. Trusted prisoners were allowed to work beyond the walls of the prison,
although they were always supervised. The work was valued as healthy, economical and
reformative. It was hoped that it might open a new life for prisoners, after their release,
away from the city. Most who have written on the subject have assumed the camps grew
out of these initial reforms.86 Diane Payne described prison camps as ‘a criterion of his
personal influence and importance’.87

in their opinion that the change would benefit both prisoners and prisons. The Gaoler at Grafton,
for instance, thought that there was ‘no more direct way of benefiting or reclaiming prisoners than
by training them to a knowledge of the right methods of tilling the soil’ Ibid, p. 17. The following
year, F. E. Bloxham, the Governor at Goulburn, thought the practice particularly good for
‘weaning off a prisoner from the erroneous idea so many have, that there is only one place for
him—the city’. See Frederick Neitenstein, Prisons; Report for 1897, Government Printer, Sydney,

We must recognise that reforms that seem of a piece to us today did not necessarily
appear this way to contemporaries, and not everything that we would now describe as
improvements were part of the same agenda. Frederick Neitenstein was certainly one of
Australia’s most energetic prison reformers, but far from being an extension of his
program, the camps were a contradiction of it. The possibility of establishing a camp in
NSW was first floated in 1906 by the then Premier Joseph Carruthers. Neitenstein
himself quashed the proposal. He felt that without the organising structure of prison
architecture there could be no way to stop criminals contaminating each other, no way to
quarantine the seeds of deviance.88 ‘Modern penologists are in agreement’, he wrote ‘as
to the moral dangers to be apprehended from the association of prisoners. In the early
days of this State we had practical experience of the shocking evils arising from such
association.’ Such camps would be ‘hotbeds of immorality’.89


Neitenstein favoured the use of carefully controlled agricultural work in conventional
prisons, by small groups of specially selected prisoners under close supervision by armed
guards. And he did so largely on financial grounds, and only at the prompting of his
deputy, Samuel McCauley.90 Neitenstein did not support the proposition that prisoners
should be confined in association, unsupervised or lightly supervised, working on farms
or in the bush.91 Trying to reform prisoners under such conditions was, he said, akin to
‘washing linen in dirty water’. The camps were in fact based on a penology that pre-dated
Neitenstein’s administration.




Walter Crofton and the Trial Bay Prison


Walter Crofton was the first chairman of directors of Irish Prisons. Appointed to the post
in 1854, when the cessation of transportation to the colonies made the development of a
new form of incarceration necessary, Crofton introduced a prison regime that became
known as the ‘progressive stage system’.92 Prisoners’ good conduct and industry were

92
    Crofton’s scheme was itself a modification of the ‘marks system’ implemented first by
Alexander Maconchie the Superintendent of the Norfolk Island prison colony in the early 1840s.
In this context, the word ‘progressive’ does not refer to progressivism as a movement, but to the
prisoners’ advance through the stages of the system. See Enoch Wines, The State of the Prisons

                                               60

rewarded with progress through various stages, beginning with solitary confinement,
passing through labour in public works gangs, and finishing with work on a prison farm
near Lusk, not far from Dublin, where prisoners worked under conditions that
approximated civilian life. The system also included provisions for individualisation of
treatment, education for the inmates, supervised release, and assistance for prisoners in
finding employment when they left prison.93 Having visited the Lusk prison farm, the
leading American penologist Enoch Wines wrote: ‘here then is a prison which is not a
prison, being without bars, bolts or encircling walls; yet in twenty years there have not
been twenty escapes… Truly Lusk is a magnificent triumph of reason and humanity’.94
The recidivism rate was around ten per cent, and the farm was also said to make a clear
profit.95 The ‘Irish System’, as Crofton’s scheme became known was taken up and
championed by English penal reformers such as Mary Carpenter and Matthew Davenport
Hill, and Crofton himself became one of the leading penal reformers of his day. His ideas
were discussed at international congresses and many felt his system signaled the future of
penology.96


Crofton’s ideas made their first appearance in Australia in the later decades of the
nineteenth century, through Harold MacLean, the NSW Sheriff, and later CGP.
Appointed in 1865, Maclean visited the UK and Ireland in 1870 and came away most
impressed with Crofton’s prison farm.97 The Trial Bay labour prison at Laggers Point on
the NSW north coast was modelled largely on Crofton’s ideas.98 Opened in 1886, the
prison was to combine reformative prison treatment with productive labour on public
works that did not interfere with private enterprise. This was to be achieved by putting the

prisoners to work constructing a breakwater. The north coast was subjected to frequent
severe storms and there were no safe waters between Port Stephens and Moreton Bay. In
the years 1862-66 alone, eighty-nine vessels and 243 lives had been lost on this stretch of
coast, so the Harbours and Rivers Department was keen to create a safe haven in the bay
using prison labour. The idea appealed to the Premier, Henry Parkes. He had led a select
committee inquiry into NSW’s prisons in 1861 which recommended the extension of
public works by prisoners. Maclean saw an opportunity to put the Lusk principles into
operation. Parkes approved Maclean’s plans to house prisoners in huts, and set them to
work building the breakwater free of all restraint except their word. Construction was
delayed though, and work did not began until 1877, and was not finished until 1886.99 In
the meantime, Parkes lost office. His successor, John Robertson, ‘did not share Maclean’s
faith in open prisons’. At Robertson’s insistence, the plan was changed, and the prison
was built on conventional lines, complete with cellblocks built from the local pink
granite.100


Despite Robertson’s intervention, the Trial Bay prison bore traces of Crofton’s scheme,
for a time at least. Maclean declared the prison was ‘destined to fill an exceptionally
important place’ in the colony’s prison system. Prisoners laboured beyond the prison
walls, and some were permitted a number of privileges. Well behaved prisoners were
granted licences which permitted them to live in wooden barracks, still within the prison
wall, in groups of five. They were permitted to swim and fish as long as they did not
cross the borders of the prison reserve. They could also apply for leave of absence for up
to seven days.101 Of 693 license holders discharged up to 1893, only seventy-two or just
under fourteen per cent had been reconvicted, and the prison was hailed as the most
progressive step made to date in NSW penal reform.102

Maclean died in 1889, however, and under his successors, George Miller and Frederick
Neitenstein, things changed. Licenses and leave of absences were no longer granted. The
wooden barracks were demolished and all prisoners were held in the stone cellblocks. At
the end of each day, all inmates now heard the iron bars clang behind them. The amount
of labour demanded of inmates was increased and the rate of pay for their work reduced.
Friction between the Prisons and the Habours and Rivers departments increased.104
Ultimately, the breakwater proved a failure. An engineering nightmare, it was continually
washed back into the sea by the storms it was supposed to withstand. Less than 300
metres were built in fourteen years, and the small sheltered area created was badly silted
up.105 In 1903 a violent tempest ripped forty-five metres of rock from the wall ‘and

    A similarly frustrating experiment with water, rock and convict labour took place in Tasmania
in the 1830s. Hundreds of convicts were set to work building a causeway across the River Derwent
at Bridgewater. Rock was hewn from the quarry, crushed, and wheeled to the riverbank. ‘As each
load was tipped into the soft mud it promptly sank’, writes Hamish Maxwell-Stewart. ‘It was the
most soul-destroying labour—ton after ton of rock disappeared in to the tidal flats’; see Maxwell-

reduced the remainder to a shapeless mass’.106 Frederick Neitenstein, the CGP at the time,
was strongly opposed to the Crofton system, and the evils he believed it caused by
congregating the labouring prisoners. He took the opportunity to do away with what he
considered an expensive and unsound institution. He called it ‘a great relief to the general
policy of the Department’. In any case, by this time, steamships had largely replaced
sailing craft on the coast, so the need for the breakwater had dissolved. The experiment at
Trial Bay had lasted only seventeen years and had cost £186,000.107 Still, it was the real
precursor to the camps, not Neitenstein’s gardens. Having rid the NSW prison system of
Maclean’s Crofton-inspired folly, Neitenstein believed it to be near-perfect, and was not
loathe to say so.108




PRISON CAMPS AND THE TAINT OF THE PENAL PAST


Neitenstein’s opposition to the camps was based partly on his understanding of the NSW
convict past. Perceptions of the convict era have played a crucial but neglected role in
Australian prison reform discourse. The future dreamt of by progressive reformers turns
out, on closer inspection, to say less about what that future might look like than it does
about administrators’ and politicians’ fervent wishes to avoid being seen to repeat the
mistakes of the past.


Scientific penology defined itself largely by contrast with the old ‘criminal codes’, which
were, as Henry Boiles wrote,


         in the light of twentieth century intelligence, a conglomeration of penalties of
         various degrees of atrocity, irrationality, absurdity and inutility. They are relics of
         blind social struggles against social evils, useful chiefly as antiquities, to be
         collected with thumb-screws, iron boots, racks and torture wheels in museums.109


The stigma of convictism has made the aversion to the penal past particularly acute in
Australia. Penologists were in near-universal agreement on the evils of the Australian

David Hall.

convict system. William Tallack thought the British practice of transportation of convicts
to penal settlements as one of the great crimes committed by any society in history.110 As
noted in chapter one, the historiography of punishment in Australia is oddly
disconnected, with little work linking the convict age and the post-transportation period.
As a consequence, it is difficult to see how the convict legacy conditioned later penal
policy. In reality, the two periods are connected in important and interesting ways, as
Mark Finnane has observed.111


The convict taint was grist to the mill for prison reformers around the country. In Victoria
at the turn of the century, the Reverend Charles Strong celebrated the transformation of
the criminal law ‘since penal settlements disgraced Australia’. But, he asked, quoting
Charles Dickens:


        Are we to believe that there is no further evolution, and that laws and methods
        which came to us from an earlier, a less enlightened and aristocratic age, do not
        need to be reviewed and revised by us today?


‘We want’, Strong said, ‘our penal system dragged into the light of day’.112


Nearly twenty years later, as Pentridge Prison seethed with unrest, the spectre of Van
Diemen’s Land made an appearance in the Victorian parliament. William Edgar, a
Member of the Legislative Council, stood brandishing a large padlock which he claimed
had once fastened the door of the condemned cell at Port Arthur, and declared that ‘the
prison system had not improved with the march of progress’.113 The following year, The
Age was still calling for progress through the abandonment of the past:


        The abominable deeds perpetrated under the sanction of past penal laws probably
        make the most hateful reading to be found in the annals of civilization… Every
        day it is becoming more certain that the old pathways of reform must be
        forsaken, the old instruments must be discarded… Punitive discipline has been
        fully tried, and has been found wanting… The new call is for greater sympathy,

         greater understanding, greater faith in the capacity of the least promising piece of
         humanity to respond to the higher appeal.114


The popular image of a brutal penal past rested on four central tropes: floggings, leg-
irons, the dark cells and the broad arrow.115 More than anything else, the abolition of
these features of prison life was held up as proof of progress. The broad arrow had been
‘relegated to the past’, crowed a Sydney journalist who visited Parramatta Prison in
1926.116 In 1917, NSW CGP Samuel McCauley noted proudly that ‘Floggings have not
been inflicted for many years, dark cells and solitary confinement have been discarded…
Prisoners are now treated as human beings’.117 In 1921, looking back and looking
forward, Neitenstein made a vague reference to ‘the ideal prison’ in which he said ‘a man
has his faults remedied by scientific methods’. The only indication he could give as to
what this might look like was to say what it was not: ‘the gag and the lash went by the
board … for the same reason that the dark cell went—because they were fool methods. I
could never see any sense in them. These things only tended to develop the animal in
man.’118 What is of interest in this remark, and many others just like it, are the peculiar
assumptions that abandoning past practices alone stands as proof of progress, and that
change itself is virtuous.119


Thus, it is unsurprising that the evils of the convict system were regularly evoked to
underscore the humanity of the prison camps all around Australia. ‘What a change has
taken place since the savagery of our forefathers’, Thomas Walker, a Member of the

were no members of staff who knew how to properly inflict one. See: ‘No Prison Man Able To

Western Australian Legislative Assembly, said, celebrating the opening of the Pardelup
Prison Farm.120


Emu Plains symbolised the perceived evolution particularly well. Not only was it the site
of Australia’s first prison farm, but, during the convict period, an infamous agricultural
station had been located there. The coincidence lead many to believe the two institutions
occupied the same land. This was not the case, but the juxtaposition was irresistible for
many commentators.121 ‘There are many years between the old convict system and the
farm at Emu Plains’, one journalist gushed, shortly after the farm opened, ‘but who would
go back?’ The convict past pressed heavily at Emu Plains, and even now ‘leg irons and
handcuffs are occasionally turned up in the soil’ as an ‘echo of a grisly past’. But the new
prison was a tribute to William Holman’s ‘humanity and breadth of vision’.122 Four years
later, the writer J. H. M. Abbot visited the farm and found that there,


        Nothing but redemption is aimed at… How far it is removed from the old
        brutalising system of prison management, which for so long disgraced New
        South Wales, one has only to look into the records, and to visit Emu Plains, to
        realise.123


Justice Minister William McKell visited the farm the following year. He was impressed
by location, where the young inmate could gaze over


        the river flat, where the Nepean wanders, through tree-lined banks, and watch the
        sun rising behind the hills, and lighting up one of the prettiest bits of river
        landscape in Australia. It is a long stride from Pinchgut and the old convict
        days.124

the convict system, an impression perhaps due, in part, to ‘The Plains of Emu’, a famous early
nineteenth song of exile and suffering, which included the refrain ‘And endless my thrall on the
Plains of Emu’. In fact the original farm was both humane and successful; see Grace Karskens,

According to The Advertiser, the camps and farms were proof that NSW had cast off the
shackles of its past to become ‘the leader in the southern hemisphere so far as the humane
treatment of offenders is concerned’.125


Similar rhetoric coloured penal discourse In Western Australia, where the memory of
convictism remained most fresh.126 When the Pardelup Prison Farm opened, John Drew
pronounced it an opportunity for prisoners ‘to redeem the past’. But in a sense, it was the
state of Western Australia that sought to redeem its past. Pardelup was founded on an old
colonial property. According to Drew, the property’s pioneering history was particularly
felicitous: ‘The men … are continually confronted with examples of conquest over very
great difficulties and hardships’. Having invoked the pioneering period, however, Drew
was careful to draw a line between the modern, scientific, progressive system the prison
farm represented and the dark days when estates like Pardelup were cut from the bush by
convict labour:


        At the time the old settlement was being fashioned from the forest, many men,
        under the ban of society for offences of a very trivial nature, compared with the
        offences for which men today are segregated from their fellowmen, were treated
        with all the harshness and cruelty of a prison system, the thought of which, even
        now, makes one shudder … and had any scheme for the establishment of a State
        prison farm, on lines similar to those upon which the farm at Pardelup has been
        established, then been put forward, it would have been killed by ridicule before
        its germ of humanitarianism had had time to penetrate the less advanced social
        conscience of the day. If Pardelup provides evidences of determination and
        successful pioneering, it also provides a symbol of time’s changing processes and
        advancements.127


In South Australia, just months after the Kyeema Prison Camp opened, The Advertiser
rejoiced that ‘the solitary confinement of which relics remain in the prison ruins at Port
Arthur, has, happily, disappeared with the savagery of the old criminal code.’128 If proof
were needed of the historical distance between old prisons and new, it could be found in

    Tasmania also felt the legacy of the convict past keenly; see Michael Roe, ‘A. G. Ogilvie and

Studies, vol. 1, no. 2, 1986.

Fullarton visited the camp. In the visitors’ book he wrote: ‘How can you compare this
with the old method? Wonderful’.130




The Swish of the Lash at Kuring-gai Chase


The effect of popular understandings of Australia’s penal past on prison reform is neatly
illustrated by an abortive experiment in the early 1930s, based on the results at NSW’s
prison camps. These Depression years were difficult ones for administrators, politicians
and prisoners, as they were for society generally. As the ranks of the unemployed
swelled, so too did the prison population, which was already on the rise due to the effects
of the Vagrancy (Amendment) Act 1929—popularly known as the Consorting
Act—which prohibited social contact between known offenders. Whereas 291 people
were behind bars for every 100,000 people in State during the financial year 1927–28,
this had risen to 308 the following year.131 By the midpoint of 1931, the prisons were
groaning with 402 imprisoned per hundred thousand in the general population. In the
same period, the total number of prison entries rose from 7092 to 10,135.132 By December
1930, all the state’s prison camps were full.133


In early 1930, Justice Minister Jack Lee proposed to put a number of prisoners to work
constructing a scenic drive through the Kuring-gai Chase National Park.134 The prisoners
would be housed in floating camps—the hulks of two old destroyers, the ‘Swan’ and the
‘Parramatta’, which were to be moored in Cowan Creek on the Hawkesbury River.135 The
proposal was supported by Kuring-gai Council, but it ignited a storm of protest in the
press.136 The Labor Daily claimed that the Bavin Government wanted, ‘to hear the swish
of the lash, and the clank of the chains of the unfortunate creatures at the mercy of

persons in authority’. With the exception of some of the southern states in the USA,
‘every civilised community’ in the world regarded ‘prison labour upon public works …
as detestable’. The hulks came under particular fire: ‘The Directors of the Convict System
may have regarded that hulk as a “floating camp” but most other persons considered it to
be a ‘floating hell”’.137


Together with trade unionists, the trustees of the park led a determined opposition to the
proposal. Describing it as ‘a vicious and retrograde step’, one of the trustees denounced
the plan as a ‘recrudescence of the chain-gang system’.138 The Daily Guardian
encouraged the trustees: ‘Stick to your guns; keep prison labour and prison hulks out of
your beautiful panorama of stream and hill’. Calling for the work to be carried out by free
labour, the editor went on to ask ‘why choose one of the loveliest scenes in all the world
… to be the setting for two convict hulks?’ It would only evoke the ‘degrading legends’
of the past.139 In parliament, Lee came under attack from other members who called the
idea ‘an outrage against all the feelings of the majority of the community’.140


Arthur Griffith, one of the trustees, also thought that given the proximity of the Chase to
the city, residents of Sydney ‘would make trips to see “chain gangs” at work’.141 He later
admitted that the productive employment of prisoners in the open was ‘undoubtedly wise
and humane’ but insisted that such labour should be employed only beyond the
metropolitan area’.142 Lee did not deny that the prisoners would excite general interest,
but argued that with the eyes of the public on them, prisoners would be less likely to
attempt to escape and would perform the work to a higher standard. Lee saw no
difference between the Cowan Creek camp and the other prison camps. ‘You can go to
Emu Plains any day and shake hands with prisoners over the fence’, he later said in
Parliament.143 Lee attempted to cast the proposal as a simple extension of the policy of
William McKell, his predecessor, but McKell saw a significant difference. The camps at
Tuncurry and Bombala were, he said, set aside as penal areas. At Cowan Creek, prisoners
would be ‘working on a public road to which no one could be denied access’, and would

be housed in hulks, ‘which in itself was a departure from the prison camp principle
already adopted by the State’.144


Lee had few supporters. A motion in favour of the scheme was carried a public meeting
of the Howard Prison Reform League on 25 March, but only by a slender margin.145
Among the press, The Sun was one of the few mastheads to support the scheme. ‘There is
no lash and no triangles’, it said, ‘no brutal prison commandants of sadist proclivities to
make the prisoners’ life a hell … there is not the slightest analogy between the life of the
convicts in these camps and that of the convicts who built our first roads’. The
afforestation camps had shown that such camps were not degrading, but rather eagerly
sought by the prisoners. The idea should be recognised ‘as a step forward in penal
practice, rather than a step back’. Opposition to the scheme on these grounds, The Sun
opined, was a disguise for a different objection: that of free labour. Pointing out that the
road would not and could not be built by free labour, abandoning the camp would be ‘to
condemn the prisoners to go on knitting socks and winding balls of yarn, without helping
the unemployed to one meal’. The men who put forward this argument, The Sun argued,
looked not for ‘logic’ but for ‘any stick to beat their dog’.146


Prisoners had in fact been building roads for a long time, out of sight of the public. At the
Brookfield Afforestation Camp, near Bombala, prisoners had been engaged on road work,
as prisoners at Tuncurry had been, years earlier. Lee had the officer-in-charge at Bombala
submit a report on the attitudes of prisoners there to road work. ‘Far from considering
that they were going back to the days of convict customs’, the officer wrote:


        nine tenths of the prisoners at this camp volunteered for and were most eager and
        anxious to be placed in the road gang. Despite the fact that this gang is by far the
        hardest worked of all, I almost daily have requests from prisoners working on
        other jobs to be considered for the first vacancy on the road. A prisoner came
        down to the office a few days ago and thanked me for changing him from the
        nursery, where the work is comparatively light, to the roads, He said that his
        health was greatly improved, and that he was eating and sleeping better than he
        had done for years. The prisoner said that he was quite content to work for the
        remainder of his sentence with a pick and shovel. This was from an intelligent

        and well-educated man, and goes to prove that the prisoners themselves do not
        consider that they are in any way going back to the days of the broad arrow.147


Despite the vocal opposition, prisoners were working from the hulks as of late August
1930.148 At that time, overcrowding in the prison system was so severe that seventy
healthy prisoners at Long Bay were sleeping in the lock hospital. Three hundred prisoners
had absolutely no work to keep them occupied, and the government hoped that as many
as two hundred of these could be employed at Cowan Creek.149 But by March 1931,
public opinion had set firmly against the scheme, and the camp was closed, having held
an average of only ten prisoners at a time. Much of the material from the camp was sent
to Emu Plains, where it was used to build extra accommodation.150


The incident quickly became a dim memory, remembered by only a few. The Reverend
James Barrett of Bombala had a keen interest in penal reform. He recalled the episode at
Cowan Creek well. ‘The cry of “hulks” a year or so ago’, he wrote, ‘wasted government
money and stopped an interesting experiment in road making by prison labour’.151
According to former NSW CGP, John Moroney, the camp failed, despite its similarity to
the prison farm at Emu Plains, ‘because of its similarity to, and evocation of, happenings
100 years earlier’.152


The camp may have been short-lived, but the effects of its fate lingered on in the
management of prisons in NSW. Stung by the Cowan Creek incident, the Prisons
Department became extremely cautious about employing prisoners on public works, or at
least public works in places the public might notice. In October 1932 the department was
approached by the Oberon Shire Council. One of the public roads within the shire led to
the Oberon Afforestation Camp and was in a bad state. The council felt that since the
traffic along the road was largely vehicles on prison business, that the department should
carry out the necessary repairs. William Hinchy, the Comptroller-General, and Lewis

of the fate of Cowan Creek observed that ‘it is against public policy to use prisoners to
make or repair public roads’.153


There was something in the image of prisoners at road-making that unnerved prison
reformers and concerned citizens alike. While they agitated for prisoners to be employed
at farming and forestry beyond prison walls, or quarrying and manufacturing within
them, very few would speak approvingly of road-making in public. Road-making was,
like the broad arrow and leg-irons, so redolent of a past best forgotten, that it trumped all
other considerations.154




CONCLUSION


In many ways, the experience of prisoners at camps across the country did in fact
resemble that of the convicts. Royal Commissioner Justice Nagle acknowledged as much,
in his 1978 report, where he said that ‘despite the claimed innovation of the “open” prison
system … it was, in some respects, no more than a return to practices which had existed
100 years earlier.”155 The farm and forestry camps could be brought under what Michel
Foucault called ‘the veil of administrative decency’.156 Out of sight of the city, they
soothed urban, middle class Australian anxieties, rather than confronting them as the
Cowan Creek road gang did. In this fracture we can begin to discern some of the
contradictions and complications of penal reform.


On the one hand the camps represent some of the great technocratic experiments of
twentieth-century penology: a therapeutic focus, individualisation of treatment,
indeterminate sentences, and minimum security institutions. Seen in this light, the farms
and camps seem a thoroughly modern innovation. On the other hand, they hark back to
earlier, nineteenth-century modes of imprisonment, as well as to nostalgic myths of
agrarianism.157 But it was politically impossible to look to the past for models in

formulating penal policy, especially the convict past. Administrators found themselves
forced to represent proposed changes, including prison camps, in ways that avoided
comparison with the convict system. In early twentieth century Australian prison
discourse there could be no place for reform understood as return.

                 Prison Camps and Penal Architecture



        Tensions are inevitable in prisons, tensions caused by the walls themselves.
               John Morony, former NSW Comptroller-General of Prisons (1988)1




In 1992 David Grant, an administrator with executive experience in three Australian
penal systems, wrote: ‘Prison design is an exercise in material penal philosophy’. Since
ideas change more rapidly than buildings, looking at the physical fabric of a penal system
was, he thought, akin to ‘looking back into the past, in the same way that examining the
night sky is looking back into the history of the universe’.2


We have seen how ideas circulating outside the prison—the imperatives of progressive
politics and the spectre of the penal past—shaped the prison farm movement and the
nature of prison reform in general. This chapter, and the next, trace the pressures arising
from within: problems of prison design and management. If penal systems have not
followed an orderly march towards increasingly enlightened standards, then the question
arises: what did drive change? The argument of this chapter is that change was driven by
prison managers’ persistent failure to solve one of their most fundamental problems: how
to arrange bodies in space within the prison. Important consequences flowed from the
degree to which a prison’s architecture separated prisoners, and permitted their
association. Over the course of more than two hundred years, separation and association
have each been considered as both obstacles and aids to ‘reformation’, and the principles
of prison design have varied accordingly. If it is to be properly understood as an exercise
in penal reform, the establishment of the camps must be seen in the context of this
evolving debate.

Historians of penal architecture have shown how, in the first half of the nineteenth
century, the penitentiary was born of a faith in the power of architecture as a ‘moral
science’. Older gaols lacked a specialised architecture, and did not permit attempts to
separate or classify prisoners. New penitentiaries, such as Pentonville Prison in London,
sought to address these problems through a radical reconfiguration of penal space. The
dirty, cramped dungeons in which great, noisy groups of prisoners were herded gave way
to clean, silent, ruthless cells inhabited by single inmates. The plans for Jeremy
Bentham’s famous panopticon also sprang from this line of thought. Historians have
traced how these new buildings embodied great hopes for the reformation of
criminals—hopes which faded long before the buildings were abandoned, but not before
the ideas on which they were based were transmitted to the Australian colonies.3


By the end of the nineteenth century, administrators both in Australia and around the
world recognised serious problems with the architecture of cellular confinement. Some
looked to address these difficulties by modifying internal arrangements, but as Mark
Finnane has noted, the buildings themselves came to be seen as the ‘enemy of discipline
and rehabilitation rather than as an aid to the original, inspiring principles of modern
penitentiary design’.4


As the penitentiary’s design principles waned, architects lost interest in the work of
building prisons. Historians too have been uninterested in the history of penal architecture
beyond the end of the nineteenth century. The interest of historian and architect alike only
rekindles during the second half of the twentieth century when administrators sought
escape-proof prisons for intractable prisoners, as well as new architectural forms to

obscure the penal identity of prison buildings.5 Prison camps have scarcely featured in
these narratives.


At first glance, there seems to be little to say about the architecture of prison farms. Huts
and tents require no architect to design, and many prison camps were constructed entirely
by prison labour. However, by excluding the camps from the history of penal
architecture, historians have implied that the architecture of the camps, rudimentary as it
is, has little or nothing to do with the penological promise of the camps.


The major work on the history of Australian penal architecture, Joan and James Kerr’s
Out of Sight, Out of Mind, omits the years 1908-1963 without explanation, despite
purporting to cover the period 1788-1988.6 The hiatus more or less coincides with the ebb
in confidence in penal architecture, and with the period in which great hopes were held
for prison camps. This omission reflects the Kerrs’ focus on penal architecture as a form
of heritage. Like many heritage scholars, they were more interested in large, early,
elaborate constructions than later, simple or flimsy structures.


Prison camps do have an important place in the story of penal architecture, and should be
woven into it. Their unsophisticated structures should not blind us to the fact that they
embodied penological principles of association and separation just as much as more
complex buildings. The camps were a response to the perceived problems of the
penitentiary; they were a new chapter in the history of penal architecture.




‘THE INSTIGATOR OF VIRTUE’: PENITENTIAL ARCHITECTURE


The walls, bars, cages, radial wings, and central observation points of the modern prison
immediately identify the nature and purpose of the structure. Yet prisons have not always
had such an immediately recognisable form. In pre-modern confinements such as the
stock, the cage and the pillory, the captivity of prisoners was a spectacle. The Houses of
Correction established in the early seventeenth century were the first penal institutions to
remove the offender from public view and public space, but they were not purpose-built

structures.7 They were usually ‘colonizations of existing sites and structures’ such as
palaces and gatehouses, and had no special qualities as places of punishment.8


By the late eighteenth century, when the famous sheriff and philanthropist John Howard
launched his investigations into the state of England’s prisons, the Bridewells were seen
as relics of failure, and the gaols were in a truly appalling state.9 London’s infamous
Newgate gaol was renowned as a place of horror, so rife with disease and disorder that
physicians refused to attend patients within. Daniel Defoe experienced the place first-
hand in the early eighteenth century, and the eponymous heroine of his novel, Moll
Flanders, was confined there too. She thought:


        the hellish noise, the roaring, swearing and clamour, the stench and nastiness, and
        all the dreadful afflicting things that I saw there, joined to make the place seem
        an emblem of hell, and itself a kind of entrance to it.10


Reformers such as Howard thought the ills of the old gaols could be remedied by better
architecture. Prison reform and prison design were thus coupled from the start. As Robin
Evans argues in his ground-breaking book, The Fabrication of Virtue, between 1750 and
1850


        the prison became the central object of penal reform and architecture became
        associated with the prison as never before—this provided the ideal conditions for
        the perfecting of techniques that sought to make architecture the instigator of
        virtue.11


The squalor and licentiousness that surged unchecked in dungeons like Newgate would
be eliminated through rational design. The power to control relationships between
prisoners, and also between prisoners and keepers, would be taken from the hands of
corrupt, ineffective gaolers, and vested in solid, impersonal walls. The only obstacles that

Howard and his fellow reformers acknowledged were ‘neglect and bad buildings’.12
Theirs was a self-consciously new endeavour. Thomas Bowdler was, along with Howard,
appointed to a commission charged with organising a design competition for the new
prisons. ‘Our undertaking is so different from anything that was ever built in this
country’, he told one of the participating architects, that an individual might be ‘very fit
for building a church or palace and very unfit for being architect to the penitentiary
houses’. In these new buildings, prisoners would be ‘delivered into a measured,
regulated, silent world, dominated by an architecture of inescapable relationships’.13




Forms of separation, 1780s-1830s


Separation was the cornerstone of the new architecture. Separating prisoners from each
other, and placing them one to a cell, was the best and surest way to prevent the spread of
both the dreaded gaol fever, and unwanted communications. Howard himself thought
association of prisoners ‘irreligious, inhuman and impolitic’.14


Until the early eighteenth century, solitary confinement had been recognised as a terror.
Condemned prisoners were subjected to it in an attempt to break their spirits before the
procession to the gallows at Tyburn.15 But reformers re-invented solitude as an instrument
of reformation. The dread that prisoners felt at the prospect of prolonged solitude was
taken as a function of guilt, and proof of the wisdom of enforced seclusion. The
prominent Gloucester prison reformer Sir George Onesiphorus Paul declared ‘Separation
both day and night is the principle of all improvement … there is no possible degree of
separation that will not bring with it additional perfection: — it favours every species of
reform’.16


The reformers’ efforts bore fruit in the form of the Penitentiary Act, 1779 which
prescribed solitude as the initial stage of a felon’s sentence. But protests were quickly

raised against the innovations, and despite the Act, solitary confinement ‘tarnished by the
excesses of its enthusiasts’ was used less, and praised less, in the United Kingdom in the
early decades of the nineteenth century.17


Experiments with different forms of separation continued on the other side of the
Atlantic. One American reformer who strongly advocated the use of solitary confinement
was George Smith. He argued that, confined alone, each prisoner ‘will necessarily be
made the instrument of his own punishment; his conscience will be the avenger of
society’.18 At Pittsburgh and Auburn, for a time, the Americans practised extreme forms
of solitary confinement. Eighty prisoners at Auburn were subject to extreme isolation in
cells only seven by three and half feet, with truly disastrous consequences.19 The inmates
were physically and psychologically ruined, and the experiment had to be called off.
Alexis de Tocqueville and Gustave de Beaumont visited Auburn shortly after the
experiment in the course of their official tour of the United States, and later wrote: ‘In
order to reform them they had been submitted to complete isolation; but this absolute
solitude … is beyond the strength of man … it does not reform, it kills’.20


The administrators at Auburn retreated from extreme isolation. From 1823, prisoners
laboured in silent association before retiring to individual cells for the night. This new
regime became known as the Auburn or silent system, and for much of the first half of the
nineteenth century administrators and reformers in the United States argued its merits
against the separate or Philadelphia system.


The Philadelphia system derived its name from the Eastern Penitentiary in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, where it was first fully implemented. Unlike the silent system, it involved
complete separation of the prisoners from each other, meals and labour taking place
within the individual cell. It differed somewhat from the earlier experiments with solitary
confinement, as prisoners were to receive regular visits from chaplains, doctors and
warders, but the essential principle remained the same. Advocates of the system believed
that only through stripping the world and its distractions from the offender would the
introversion necessary for reform be inculcated. This, of course, could only be achieved

with the aid of a specialised, impenetrable form of architecture.21 The contest between the
silent and separate systems was one of the defining features of nineteenth century
penology, but from today’s vantage point the two models seem simply variations on a
theme.22 Advocates for both systems shared a belief that, if properly ordered, walls, doors
and gates could create spaces in which the deviant’s soul might be changed.23




‘A simple idea in architecture’: Bentham’s panopticon


The Americans eventually exported separation back to England. In the meantime,
however, British reformers had not ceased to ponder the possibilities of penal
architecture. In the 1790s Jeremy Bentham, a great opponent of convict transportation, hit
upon one of his grandest ideas. He sought to understand how ‘the human condition as a
whole’ might be ‘controlled and made certain by design’.24 This question became
Bentham’s consuming preoccupation, and, in the plans for his famous panopticon, he
believed he had found the solution.


The panopticon was a new iteration of the faith in architecture’s power to reform
prisoners and the prison. It was based less on the physical separation of prisoners than on
their continued, implicit surveillance and self-discipline.25 The building was to be
circular, with levels of individual cells ranged around the circumference, in which the
prisoners slept, worked and ate. The inward wall of each cell faced the centre of the
prison, and was a grid of bars rather than a stone wall, opening the cell to view from an
observation tower in the centre of the structure. The tower’s windows were too small for
inmates to be able to see whether or not the tower was occupied, so they would be forced
to assume that it was. Thus the labour of disciplining the prisoner was transferred from
the guard to the inmate himself. (See Figure 9).



21
   There were, according to the influential Boston Prison Discipline Society, ‘principles in
architecture, by the observance of which great moral changes can be more easily produced among
the most abandoned of our race’ (quoted in Norval Morris and David J Rothman, ‘Introduction’,
The Oxford History of the Prison: the Practice of Punishment in Western Society, Oxford
University Press, New York and Oxford, 1995, p. 106).

FIGURE 9. Sketches from Jeremy Bentham’s plans26


Once described as ‘a strange compound of semi-sound principles and impracticable
details’ the panopticon was never built as Bentham imagined it in England or Australia.27
Nevertheless, it demonstrated the extent to which architecture embodied the hopes of the
first generation of prison reformers.28 ‘What would you say,’ Bentham asked in 1803,


        if by the gradual adoption and diversified application of this single principle, you
        should see a new scene of things spread itself over the face of civilized
        society—morals reformed, health preserved, industry reinvigorated, instruction
        diffused, public burdens lightened, economy seated as it were upon a rock, the

        gordion knot of the poor laws not cut but untied—all by a simple idea in
        architecture.29


Even on paper, the panopticon’s ‘ruthless radial geometry’30 prefigured the structure than
would influence nineteenth-century Australian prison design more than any other:
Pentonville Prison.31




‘A kind of chrysalis’: Pentonville Prison


Pentonville was located in the heart of London, but its roots lay in Philadelphia. In the
United States, the Auburn, or silent system had become the most widely used model of
imprisonment, but English observers were more impressed by the Philadelphia
experiment. Solitude, first tried and then discarded in the old country, was modified and
exported back to Britain, where ‘it was greeted as if it were a novel and untried thing’.32


Pentonville opened in 1842, and its design philosophy centred on the individual cell.
Prisoners worked and ate in their cells, leaving only to go to visit the exercise yards or the
chapel. A small sliding window in the middle of the cell door permitted the prisoner to be
observed, but not to see the observer in return. Speech was forbidden and prisoners wore
masks when moving about the prison, in order to prevent them recognising each other. It
was a place where a prisoner might be ‘alone with God and a wounded conscience’.33 The
prison’s designer, Captain Joshua Jebb of the Royal Engineers, had


        brought the art of designing the solitary cell to a new perfection. At Pentonville it
        was the key to the whole institution, a kind of chrysalis within which the
        transmutation of the criminal mind was to take place.34

   As Michael Ignatieff has pointed out, while architectural historians ponder the differences
between the panopticon and Pentonville, their similarities are more significant. ‘In both, the
criminal was separated from the outside world by a new conception of social distance epitomized
by uniforms, walls, and bars.’ Ignatieff, A Just Measure of Pain, p. 113.

FIGURE 10. Separate cell at Pentonville Prison35


The construction of Jebb’s prison marked high tide for the belief in penal architecture. It
accorded with ‘a widespread perception of the evils of unmediated intercourse and a
concomitant belief that goodness could only flourish in its own space’.36 And it was a
repudiation of the old structures, such as Newgate and the Bridewells, where ‘corruption
and profanity were concentrated into one place and incidentally exhibited as a parody of
evil’. In Pentonville, ‘everything was arranged to prevent the genesis and spread of
vice’.37

It was believed that the separate cell would strip the false, deviant personality of the
prisoner, leaving a tabula rasa, on which a new self might be inscribed. According to
Pentonville’s chaplain:


        A few months in the solitary cells renders a prisoner strangely impressionable.
        The chaplain can then make the brawny navvy cry like a child; he can work on
        his feelings in almost any way he pleases; he can so to speak, photograph his
        thoughts, wishes and opinions … and fill his mouth with his own phrases and
        language.38


In its early years, Pentonville was often called ‘the Model Prison’. The early reformers’
vision seemed realised.



The architecture of separation comes to Australia, 1840s-1870s


As James Kerr writes, ‘innovative penal theory formed no part of any Australian
architectural brief: ideas always remained an essential import’.39 Faith in the power of
penitential architecture was transmitted to Australia through the plans for Pentonville40
and, at the point when most of the Australian colonies became self-governing, ‘the
dominance of the separate system as the normal mode of punishment was undisputed’.41


When drawing up plans for new prisons, colonial architects were required to consult with
Jebb, in his capacity as Surveyor General of Prisons. Indeed, many Australian penal
institutions were designed by members of Jebb’s own corps, the Royal Engineers.42
George Barney and George Gipps were particularly influential in this regard. Both men
were Royal Engineers who arrived in Australia towards the end of the convict period.

Each was also strongly influenced by the Society for the Improvement of Prison
Discipline (SIPD), one of leading promoters of the study of penal architecture.43


Pentonville was the template for many of Australia’s largest prisons, including the
separate prison at Port Arthur in Tasmania, the penitentiaries at Darlinghurst, Maitland,
Bathurst and Berrima in NSW, Pentridge in Victoria, and Fremantle in Western
Australia.44 A small short-lived separate prison was also built on Norfolk Island by
Alexander Maconochie.45 Maitland Gaol, designed by Colonial Architect Mortimer
William Lewis, opened in 1844 and was described as a ‘a colonial vision of a miniature
Pentonville’.46 Although none were as grand as the original, the colonial versions were all
were based on the same principles of separation and isolation.


William Champ was Commandant at Port Arthur when its Separate Prison was under
construction. In 1857 he took up the post of Inspector General of Victorian Penal
Establishments, following the murder of his predecessor, John Price. His ‘special project’
was the construction of a separate prison, misleadingly referred to by Champ himself and
several historians as ‘the Panopticon’. It opened in 1859, and shortly afterwards Champ
reported that ‘the softening effects … of solitude and separation from evil
communications have already exhibited themselves’.47 According to Mark Finnane,
Champ’s prison was ‘as identifiable a picture of mid-Victorian penal discipline as one
could obtain from any of Joshua Jebb’s guides to the construction and management of
prisons’.48


The most extreme application of the architecture of separation in Australia took place in
NSW. In 1870, Harold McLean, the Sheriff, thought it difficult to imagine ‘a more
effective discipline, a more deterring punishment, and a larger measure of reformation’
than that achieved through separation:

        It is striking to witness criminals passing through years of such a discipline. But
        the good effects are apparent and well established. Communication with one
        another being prohibited, a stop is put during imprisonment to corrupting
        influences; and seclusion, the essence of imprisonment, is secured, thus entirely
        doing away with what may be termed the social intercourse of prison life.49


The principles of the separate system, as Maclean understood them were codified in NSW
in the Prisons Act 1874.50 But as early as 1866, Maclean had designated Berrima Gaol a
Model Prison. Thereafter, for the first nine months of their sentences, prisoners at
Berrima were not permitted to send or receive letters. As at Pentonville, they laboured
alone in their cells with only a Bible for distraction. They exercised in yards for an hour a
day, wore masks about the prison, and were severely punished for any infraction of the
regulations.51 Maclean felt none could question the design and management of Berrima,
as it was ‘abreast of the most advanced European ideas’ and ‘the cornerstone of the penal
system of the Colony’.52




The decline of separation


By the early twentieth century, the Model Prison at Berrima was seen as a relic of failure.
In the course of four decades, the design principles that had promised to improve both
prisons and prisoners came to be seen as not only antiquated, but positively callous. This
remarkable reversal of penological thought, leads directly to the establishment of the
prison camps.


The architecture of separate confinement had its critics from the start. In 1799, Samuel
Coleridge had recoiled from the practice.53 The American experiments with solitude also
found their critics. De Tocqueville and de Beaumont were not the only visitors to the
New World to be horrified by isolating prisoners in this way. Charles Dickens held ‘this

slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than
any torture of the body’.54


Pentonville too raised concerns about the effects of separate confinement on prisoners’
physical and mental health. Accounts of madness there surfaced as early as 1843.55
Mayhew and Binney reported that the Model Prison turned out ‘upwards of ten fold more
madmen’ than any other prison in England or Wales.56 Alone in their cramped, viewless
cells, prisoners’ ‘personalities were turned terribly against them in a setting that could
have been an ossuary for the living’.57


Recidivism rates remained unchanged.58 In fact, the Model Prison had not even
succeeded in keeping its inmates separate or silent,59 but the elaborate and very expensive
buildings remained. Evans writes:


           Orderly and solitary they still were, but drained of all purpose these qualities
           became inexplicable and timeless … Where there had been disorder, licence and
           corruption through intercourse there was now an unrelenting repetition of futile
           tasks performed within the close bleak perspective of converging walls.60

   Prisoners found a range of ways to communicate, to pass information and the recognition of
each others’ presence. Even in prisons ostensibly operating under the ‘silent system’, such as the
Kingston penitentiary in Canada, prisoners

           Talked to each other surreptitiously through holes in the cell walls, in the work shop and
           during chapel service and in the dining hall. They sang individually and they sang
           together and they even sang while they danced. They sang and they shouted all the way to
           the punishment cells and continued singing and shouting there, only louder. They
           gossiped, shouted, cursed, whistled, coughed, pretended to cough and imitated different
           varieties of animals…finally, when prisoner could not cause disruptions with their
           mouths, they used their eyes. They stared silently, strangely and steadily at the guards.

From the 1850s, as official disillusionment deepened over the apparent failure of the
penitentiary, architects became uninterested in penal reform.61 Isolation and separation
gradually became tools for an explicitly punitive form of prison discipline. But prison
reformers remained, and they attached their hopes to new architectural forms. It was
during this period that interest in the Mettray Agricultural Colony quickened, while in
Ireland, observers were struck with the results at the Lusk Farm, where prisoners lived in
moveable iron huts.62 Walter Crofton, its founder, still believed separation to be an
essential component of imprisonment but its purpose was now explicitly to punish and to
cow; reform was only held to have a place and be possible in the ‘intermediate’ stage at
the farm or the quarry.63


Between 1866 and 1913, penal administrators in Australia became progressively more
aware of the defects of intense and prolonged separation, and less convinced of the evils
of association. Senior administrators, ex-prisoners, concerned citizens and former guards
alike thought it cruel and unnecessary.64 In 1877, the Victorian Inspector General George
W. Duncan toured a number of foreign counties. During his time in the United States,
Duncan, who had until this point been a staunch advocate of separation, inspected the
Philadelphia Penitentiary. The extreme application of separation he witnessed there
planted doubts in his mind.65 By the end of his term in office, Duncan was deeply
skeptical as to the value of separation. In 1880 he admitted that he did not believe ‘that
seclusion would make the man or woman so isolated stronger to resist evil … outside the
prison walls’.66

Berrima was singled out for particular concern, and it was the subject of a Royal
Commission in 1878. The commissioners found that the governor of the prison, William
Small ‘had a hasty temper’ and resorted to the gag and spread-eagling too frequently, but
they were not persuaded that there was a problem with the separate system itself. Public
and popular opinion held otherwise. John Longford, former warder at Darlinghurst
thought no punishment as severe as separate treatment. Prisoners, he said ‘have been
known to suffer untold hardships in the endeavour to escape it’.67 Questions were asked
in Parliament about the frequency of suicide attempts and self-mutilations under the
system.68


In England, the landmark 1896 Gladstone Report rejected total separation, and prompted
renewed calls for its abandonment in NSW. However, Maclean’s successor, George
Miller, clung pugnaciously to the principles of separate treatment. In June 1896, near the
end of his term, he defended the system in the face of sustained public concern. To do
away with separation, he stated


        would simply be a ruinously retrogressive step, throwing the department back a
        century, to the time when the great prison reformer Howard became a strong
        advocate of it after his experience of the horrors of association of prisoners … I
        cannot conceive anything which would have a worse effect upon the prisoners of
        this colony … Some say separate treatment is unnatural. This may also be said of
        any form of confinement within prison walls. But society must be protected from
        criminals … A man who is not a criminal by nature prefers cellular separation to
        being placed in association with criminals. It is the real criminal, who wants to be
        among ‘pals’ who hates it, and pretends that it injures him mentally and
        physically.69


Never again would such claims be made for the reformatory value of separation in NSW.
Neitenstein followed Miller as CGP, and at first he thought separation ‘the true basis of
effective prison management’. But his experience forced him to acknowledge its limits.
He conceded that in practice it could verge dangerously on outright solitary confinement.

He sought a compromise. The result was the ‘restricted association’ system of prison
management. Prisoners were to be separated for meals and rest, but were to be allowed
limited, supervised association during times of work and exercise, and this association
was to hinge on a system of classification to prevent so-called ‘incorrigibles’ from
contaminating hopeful cases.70 From October 1897, following continued public outcry
about the effects of separate confinement, even Berrima was placed under the restricted
association system.71 ‘The plan aimed’, Neitenstein wrote,


        at limiting the association without going too far in the direction of solitary
        confinement. It was felt that a too rigid seclusion would be unnatural, and would
        bring about evils of its own … [the prisoner with a sincere desire to reform] will
        have the companionship of his fellows while at work, but he will secure a
        wholesome privacy at meals and at all other times.72


Neitenstein became increasingly aware of the problems of separate treatment as he spent
more time at the helm of the Prisons Department.73 By the time he retired, real separation
was almost unknown in the state’s prisons, except purely as a punishment.74 In 1916 new
prison regulations were promulgated abolishing mandatory separate treatment for young
prisoners. ‘Now when the prisoner arrives at the gaol he is immediately set to work,
generally in the open air’, the Sydney Morning Herald reported approvingly.75 In 1917,
the ‘liberty stage’ was abolished. This had formed the last month of a prisoner’s sentence,
during which he was returned to separate confinement, to prepare spiritually to re-enter
society.76 Berrima was closed the year after Neitenstein retired. The falling prison
population, combined with changes in the use of separate treatment ‘rendered the use of

this establishment unnecessary’, Samuel McCauley said.77 Berrima quickly became
emblematic of a dark, vindictive past.78 By 1930, the NSW Minister for Justice, John R.
Lee could look back at the closing of Berrima with almost smug satisfaction:


        It had for some time stood for the final stage of prison punishment and
        degradation, and a prisoner committed to that Institution was always looked upon
        as beyond the pale of ordinary measures of reform. Its abolition marked the final
        passing of coercive measures.79


Outside NSW too, the architecture of separation was discredited. In Western Australia it
was used as a part of reformatory discipline until 1912. Its use for this purpose was then
discontinued on the grounds it ‘was found to derange the minds of some of the prisoners
subjected to it’.80 Only four years after the practice was discontinued, Chief Secretary J.
M. Drew asked:


        Of what use is it to preach charity, forbearance and goodwill to a broken creature
        who has been through the tortures and suffered the barbarism of the ‘cage’ and
        the ‘separate’ cell; to subject an unfortunate to those devices of the devil and
        expect him to learn from them the Divine attributes of meekness and
        charity?—the pity of it!81

At French Island, habitual criminals mingled freely with younger criminals. This had,
Samuel Mauger said, ‘no ill-effect. The reformatories create the reform atmosphere’.82
The mother of a young man discharged from Emu Plains in 1918 wrote to McCauley to
express her ‘sincere and heartfelt gratitude for placing him in the company of those who
under more congenial surroundings have done more for him in showing him the future
path of honor than years of detention in a confined prison’.83


By the 1930s, the separate system was comprehensively discredited as a reformatory tool.
The Victorian Inspector General, Joseph Akeroyd, thought the system, ‘once looked upon
as the reformative part of the prison system, has now been discarded and is used only as a
punitive measure’.84 A century and a half earlier, reformers such as Howard had
acknowledged only neglect and bad buildings as the obstacles to reform. The greatest
difficulties arose, as far as Akeroyd was concerned though, from the ‘obsolete and
unsuitable buildings’ built to enable separate confinement.85 The prison was once again
trapped in its own form.


Early twentieth-century reformers looked on the penitentiaries as Howard had upon
Newgate, and saw in prison camps a deliverance. Writing in 1934, a Queensland reformer
argued:


          The truth of the matter is that prison life in Queensland harks back to the
          barbarous dark ages … the whole separate cell system as adopted in this State is
          hopelessly antiquated and needlessly cruel … We have progressed far in many
          directions in Queensland, but prison reform is not one. In other parts of Australia
          there are prison camps, where the men have the advantage of continual

         association and a healthy out-of-doors life, but conditions at Boggo Road have
         scarcely altered in half a century. Is not it about time something was done?86


Isolation and separation, once seen as the foundation of reformatory discipline, were now
seen as the root of many of the prison’s problems, and proof of a benighted past.
Meanwhile, association, Newgate’s original sin, was rehabilitated as an essential element
of modern penology.87




NOR IRON BARS A CAGE: THE ARCHITECTURE OF PRISON CAMPS


The history of penal architecture has been examined at length for two reasons. First, to
show the faith and resources invested in the idea that reform hinged upon separation and
isolation. Second, to demonstrate how the prisons that were built to separate and isolate
created a new set of problems, and came to be regarded with the same indignant outrage
that the first reformers reserved for prisons in which congregation was the norm. This
reversal generated new prison design principles, which are clearly embodied in the
camps.


Sernack Cruise has correctly argued that Neitenstein’s restricted association system was a
response to the problems of separation. No historian though, has recognised that the
camps represented a further step in this direction. In this manner, huts, tents, dormitories
were an innovation in penal architecture.88

   Although Neitenstein’s attitude toward association changed over time, he was never comfortable
with the idea of prison camps. Writing as ‘Lex’, Neitenstein or one of his sympathisers protested
at the introduction of the camps in NSW, clearly worried about what a group of men working up a
sweat in the bushes might get up to: ‘The gathering together for months and years at a time of a
number of unmarried men, or men whose wives are necessarily separated from them, is a sizeable
enough menace to morality in itself. Proper supervision is impossible in the circumstances’. ‘Lex’,

FIGURE 11. Tents at road-making camp, Tuncurry c.193089



Camp architecture and layout was basic and often improvised. Many camps were built
entirely by prison labour. At Tuncurry, prisoners at a satellite camp slept in tents until
1933 (see Figure 11).90 The first contingent of prisoners sent to Kyeema Prison Camp, in
March 1932, had to clear the site for the camp, and make the road to it, before they could
erect their own huts.91 Heavy rains set in before the timber for the huts arrived. In
response to a plaintive report from the OIC, the Comptroller-General wrote:


        When ordering tents was told no flys available, but assured tents sound and
        water-proof. If you have the stretchers folded and put at one end of the tent, using
        one as a stand for the folded bedclothes of the occupants, there will be plenty of
        room in each tent for the men to take their meals. One stretcher can be used as a
        table temporarily. Stores department have no further tents … Shelter for the cook

Local residents eventually took pity on their new neighbours, and lent them sheets of
galvanised iron.93 Tents were sent to Stone River State Farm in Queensland shortly after
it opened in 1945, but when they arrived it was discovered that they were missing several
important parts.94 Conditions were only a little better for the first batch of prisoners sent
to Hayes Prison Farm, in 1937. They were forced to live in an old apple-packing shed and
shower under a kerosene tin for the first few weeks.95 Afterwards, they were
accommodated in dormitories—individual huts were not built at Hayes until 1949.96


Even once the prisoners were out of make-shift quarters, problems with accommodation
remained. By the early 1940s, the buildings at the McLeod Settlement, which had been
constructed by prison labour, were described as ‘flimsy wooden “lean-to’s” and a
‘distinct menace in case of fire’. This was a very real possibility, since the camp’s
lighting was still provided by lamps and candles.97 The outbuildings were constructed on
‘a framework of saplings’ with walls and roofs of galvanised iron, much of which was
salvaged from a blaze at Pentridge in 1924.98 When local residents complained that
prisoners were free to roam around the island, they were told that the prisoners’ huts were
so dilapidated they could not be effectively locked.99 In the Legislative Assembly,

    ‘New Reformatory Prison at French Island’, The Herald, 27 December 1944. In prisoner
folklore, the early conditions at McLeod were truly frontier-like. In 1964, one inmate on the island
confidently claimed that ‘only one substantial meal was provided to the prisoners; for their other
meals they had to fend for themselves either by fishing or rabbiting. The men’s sleeping quarters
comprised of humpys [sic] that were scattered all over the colony’. See ‘Mcleod Prison Farm’,

Thomas Tunnecliffe declared the settlement possessed ‘some of the most outrageous and
primitive buildings that the mind of man could conceive’.100 A rebuilding program was
drawn up for the island camp. When it was finished, The Age thought that ‘Victoria will
have at least one reformatory prison that will measure up to modern standards of decency
and efficiency’.101


Officials sometimes sought to make a virtue out of the rudimentary architecture. In the
early 1930s, prisoners at Emu Plains were made to build farm buildings from ‘bush
timber’ to teach them ‘how to improvise’.102 Won Wron prison farm had several large
three man huts known as ‘three-outers’; according to the Director of Prisons in Victoria,
Rod Wise, these were ‘sub-standard in many respects’ but they did force prisoners ‘to
practice many of the skills they would need to re-enter their families … negotiation,
compromise, consideration of others’.103

With their primitive structures, the camps possessed one over-riding virtue: they did not
look like the reviled penitentiaries. They had an informality that prisons lacked too.
Prisoners were allowed to decorate their huts with pictures, posters and flowers long
before this ‘privilege’ was extended to prisoners in conventional prisons. When the
Minister for Justice, William McKell visited Emu Plains in 1920, he was struck by the
interior decorations. ‘It was very interesting to visit the different huts and note the
characteristics of the boys’, he remarked. Observing that most of the youths had posters
of boxers, racing horses and royalty, McKell was particularly amused by the décor of the
first hut he visited. On the wall was a large picture of the Minister himself. The Sun
speculated: ‘Was that boy-prisoner a cunning diplomat?’106


There was no typical layout to Australian prison camps. Like the early modern gaols and
Bridewells, the supposedly ultra-modern camps were often colonisations of pre-existing,
non-penal structures. At camps like those at Pardelup, Stone River, Kirkconnell, Hayes

and Dhurringile, old farms and estates were converted to use as penal camps with little
modification. Even where the camp structures were purpose built, such as at Tuncurry,
McLeod, Kyeema, Palen Creek and Emu Plains, they looked more like other types of
facilities rather than prisons. Many looked very much like army camps or holiday resorts.
There was nothing of the geometry of the penitentiary or panopticon in the camps’
design. The spatial arrangements at camp impeded rather than expedited surveillance and
security. It was usually impossible for a guard to observe a prisoner without being seen
himself. In fact, it was often impossible for a guard to observe a prisoner at all; camp
architecture and the surrounding landscapes gave prisoners ample opportunity to go
unseen for extended periods of time.107

The aesthetics and economics of prisons without walls


In 1923, Samuel Mauger used images of architecture to set out the differences between
the ‘old method’ and the ‘new method’ of treating criminals. The former was typified
with a grainy, shadowy image from Pentridge:




FIGURE 15. View of a cellblock wing at Pentridge Prison109



In 1895 in a similar prison, Wandsworth Gaol in England, Mauger reported that a youth
hanged himself from ‘the detestable crank’. Railing against the senselessness of it,
Mauger declared:


        One touch of Nature … might have restored him to his mother reformed and
        chastened … [instead] they gave him only the bare walls, the blurred windows. It
        was too much. He took his own life and set his soul free.110

Though such structures did not resemble prisons, they satisfactorily performed many of
the functions of prisons. Prisoners were held in place without walls. Indeed, at several
camps, the complete absence of restraint was seen to be essential. For years, at Palen
Creek in Queensland, Hayes in Tasmania, and the McLeod Settlement in Victoria the
prisoners huts were not even locked during the night. Victorian authorities ‘felt that the
“honour” spirit would be destroyed if the key were turned on men at night’.112 In response
to a rash of escapes from Hayes Prison Farm in 1959, the Attorney General suggested to
Controller Lonergan that a compound should be built to enclose the prisoners’ huts. In
reply, Lonergan said that he thought additional security would only encourage further
attempts to escape. ‘I think it is much better to leave things as they are … and not destroy
the honor system’.113

This seeming contradiction of confinement without security, can be traced back at least as
far as the 1830s, to the establishment of the Rauhe Haus farm home for delinquents in
Germany. Doctor Johann Wichern, the founder of the Rauhe Haus, was famous for his
dictum that ‘the strongest wall is no wall’.114 Alan Paton certainly found this to be the
case when he took over as head of the Diepkloof Reformatory in South Africa. One of his
first major acts was to take down the perimeter wall surrounding the institution. Paton
later wrote, echoing Gladstone, ‘you can’t train boys for freedom in an atmosphere of
detention’ and added: ‘Freedom within custodial walls isn’t the real thing’. After the wall
came down ‘it was like being naked’, Paton said, but rates of escape actually decreased.
With the wall down, Paton felt able to give effect to his belief in freedom as ‘the supreme
reformatory instrument’.115 (See Figures 17 and 18).


With the advent of the camps, penitentiary-style architecture came to be seen not only as
problematic, but downright outdated. In NSW, the mandatory period of separate
treatment for young offenders at the start of their sentence was increasingly waived in
order that they might spend their entire sentence at Emu Plains.116 J. Manning, the OIC at
Emu Plains thought the productivity of the farm and the health of its inmates were a ‘fine
testimonial to the action of the Department in, as it were, lifting the business of prison
discipline from the dark cloistered repression into the purer air of reason and the
industrious aspects of life’.117

distance from the main site. There, the inmates, in the final stage of their confinement, lived
largely unsupervised. Paton later described the village: ‘one can only describe the free village as
an architectural gem. The spacing of the buildings, the simplicity of their design, the white walls
and the thatched roofs made the village something to be proud of. In the moonlight it was—in my
opinion—as beautiful as the Taj Mahal’.

In 1923, the NSW CGP, William Urquhart, called for more camps along the lines of
Tuncurry, describing ‘the moral influences’ as ‘stronger than when reformable human
beings of decent social instincts are confined within the four walls of a prison … the men
gain a higher conception of their social obligations’.119 In 1932, The New South Wales
Police News reported that ‘instead of moping in cells’, inmates at Emu Plains: ‘deal with
something that grows and runs’.120 Nearly three decades later, an officer at the farm said
‘If you’re going to stand with a gun on them and bars in their windows until the day
they’re thrown out on the street, they go sour’.121


As the prison farm movement gathered momentum in Queensland in the early 1930s,
separate cellular confinement came under sustained attack there too. J. F. Whitney was,
by this time, Comptroller-General. As a young prison officer in NSW in the late 1910s,
he had been the OIC at Tuncurry. The experience etched in him a firm belief that
penitentiary-style architecture was the cause of many of the prison system’s greatest
problems and that Queensland needed to establish prison farms of its own. When Palen
Creek opened in 1934, its warm welcome in the press reflected the changing attitudes to
penal architecture:


        A prison without walls … a gaol without gaolers … the great blue dome of the
        sky instead of the dingy, dull wall of a cell … prisoners treated as men and on
        their honour instead of a chain … beneath the shade of the picturesque Mount
        Lindesay.122


By 1947 Whitney had established four prison farms, where the prisoners were ‘taken out
of the old walled prison environment and given an opportunity to work out their own
rehabilitation in congenial surroundings’.123

Officials came to doubt that closed prisons were capable of producing genuine reform,
even when positive changes were observed in closed prisons. By the 1940s, Tasmanian
penologists believed that ‘apparent reformation’ amongst prisoners at Hobart Gaol was
‘more the result of repression than any real moral improvement’.125


In 1958 a conference attended by administrators, politicians and academics involved in
prison matters was held in Sydney. Professor Morven Brown, from the University of
NSW, looked back with a forgiving, if critical eye. Nineteenth-century prison
architecture, with its ‘wings and galleries radiating like the spokes of a wheel’, was he
conceded, bequeathed to the world by Howard and his fellow reformers ‘with the best
will in the world’. Unfortunately, it represented ‘a terrible and I think cruel conception of
punishment, which in the name of reform … has done much to dehumanise prisons’.
Brown gave thanks that ‘we live in a different era’. Punishments had become less severe,

and so had penal architecture: ‘We have prison farms—very different places indeed’.126
In 1963, Bob Johnson, a reporter for the Sun Herald thought that the Kirkconnell
Afforestation camp stood ‘as material evidence of a Prisons Department swing away from
dingy cellular confinement’.127


Architectural aesthetics aside, the camps had other advantages. Large penitentiaries
designed around the one-man cell were inflexible and expensive to build and maintain.
Camps were much cheaper, and the materials could also be re-used. When the Cowan
Creek road-making camp was abandoned in 1931, the materials were sent to Emu Plains
Prison Farm. In 1940, when the old wooden huts at Emu Plains were replaced, new
concrete huts were built by the prisoners using sand and gravel from the nearby Nepean
River.128


At the 1958 conference in Sydney, Justice John Barry called for a move ‘away from the
traditional bolts-and-bars and high-walls type of prison and more and more towards the
open institution’. The sums of money involved alone justified such a move. 129 Prison
camps with their ‘cheaper and less permanent buildings’ had a great advantage over other
types of prisons, thought Ted Hartley of the NSW Howard Prison Reform Council. As
‘ideas and circumstances change so the buildings can be changed’. When the state
government announced it was drawing up plans for a new maximum security prison,
Hartley protested:


        We do not suppose that in 30 years’ time ideas about prisons will be anything
        like they are today, and it would be a disaster if the present Administration
        continued to repeat the mistake of the nineteenth century and put their ideas (and
        £1,250,000 of the taxpayers’ money) into solid stone and steel which could only
        be removed by dynamite.130

cause of constant complaint and embarrassment. In 1963, only 150 of the roughly 1200 prisoners
were in sewered cells. Plans were being drawn up to sewer the others ‘but it’s a big expensive job
punching pipes through those thick, near-bomb-proof walls’, a prison official said. See Bob

Association and permeability: a ‘new’ penal space


Aesthetics and economics were not the only important points of difference between
penitentiary and camp architecture. The camps reflected important changes in penological
theory too. The forms of ‘new’ architecture may seem unremarkable, but they represented
a different sort of penal space, one which permitted association of prisoners, and did not
sever a inmate’s sense of connection with the world beyond the prison.


The lack of walls meant that the relationships between prisoners and guards and between
prisoners and each other more closely resembled relationships in the free world, and
reformers found this reassuring. Reformers like Joseph Akeroyd and J. M. Drew argued
for penal spaces that permitted normal social interaction.131 Emu Plains was praised for
the fact that it permitted the prisoner ‘to associate with his companions’ in the recreation
room during the evenings.132 The Anglican Chaplain to the Bombala Afforestation Camp,
the Reverend Cecil Saunders, thought the social spaces of the camp vital:


         The personal talks which generally follow the service either round the camp fire
         or in the recreation room, or yet again in the privacy of the man’s own ‘hut’,
         afford useful opportunities of entering into the hearts and lives of these men.
         From these conversations one learns the immense benefit of this type of
         imprisonment on those who are not of the hardened criminal type.133




Johnson, ‘The ‘Bay. Grim And Frightening’, Sun Herald 27 January 1963. In 1976, NSW CGP
Walter McGeechan publicly admitted that none of the cell windows at Goulburn or Bathurst were
glassed, despite conceding that these prisons were located in some of the coldest areas in the state.
The price, he said, ‘of placing suitable windows on that form of architecture is just prohibitive’.

The new design principles enjoyed considerable support in the press. ‘The walled gaol’,
the Melbourne Herald argued in 1938,


         robs a prisoner of initiative and self-respect and hope. Every act of his daily
         routine is regulated for him, He cannot express himself in the smallest detail; he
         is treated as an irresponsible automaton. In the open prison camp he can have a
         reasonable measure of freedom; he can live the life of a sentient being … Instead
         of deteriorating, as inevitably he does in a closed prison, the prisoner awakens to
         responsibility and self-respect. His mind receives a new bent toward a corporate
         spirit and a decent standard of social behavior, and he is restored to liberty a
         better man.135

   ‘Prisons Old and New’, Herald, 29 July 1938. In South Australia, when the Cadell Prison Farm
finally opened in 1962, J. H. Allen said the central principle of the place was that it ‘should not in
any way resemble a prison but should be designed so that a young man would not be held in
captivity as in a prison, but be able to lead a free and corporate life where self discipline would
prevail’. Cadell Training Centre, Government Printer, Adelaide, 1962.

                                                 108

        The life of the men on the farm specially conduces to development of the
        communal spirit and to restoration of self respect. Meals in association with
        rations pooled; dormitory sleeping accommodation; friendly rivalry in games;
        interdependence in farm work; all these foster a spirit of good citizenship.136


Only a few decades earlier such ideas would have been regarded as retrograde, and
invitations to contamination. But these new attitudes towards penal architecture emerged
at the same time that an important shift took place in penological discourse.
‘Reformation’ was spoken of less and less from this time, and replaced by
‘rehabilitation’. The older term had religious overtones, and suggested a spiritual
accounting that might be accomplished in the solitude of the cell. Goodness, the early
reformers had maintained, could flourish only in its own space—a space for penitence.
‘Rehabilitation’ on the other hand, as Drew’s remarks suggest, was generally taken to
mean ‘training for good citizenship’. Goodness now needed a shared space, and a less
atomised form of architecture was therefore required.


Architecture that enabled prisoners to form quasi-normal relationships with each other
was not the only new principle of prison design seen in the camps. Reformers also called
for structures that maintained a sense of connection between the prisoner and the wider
world. In the early twentieth century it became increasingly important to convince
inmates that there was enough good in the world that it was worth the effort to conform to
its demands. Although this shift went well beyond questions of architecture alone, there
were important implications for prison design. 137


For many years officials had felt their task was to put prisoners in a place where they
could find ‘the good’ within themselves, and that prisoners would only be shamed or
degraded through contact with the outside world. Penal architects in the Pentonville era
believed that the penitentiary depended on the absence of distractions that might allow
the prisoner to imaginatively escape the world inside the walls. At Pentonville itself, the

137
    Prison newspapers were introduced too, also to give prisoners a sense of connection with the
wider world. The aim of The Compendium, one of the first of these newspapers, was to give
prisoners ‘a general idea of the world’s progress, so that a man leaving prison will not have, in
addition to other difficulties, that of attempting to conceal his ignorance concerning events well
known to everyone else’. ‘Introduction’, The Compendium, 1 December 1912, p. 1.

                                               109

windows were set high in the wall, the bars were thick, and the panes of fixed, fluted
glazing allowed ‘a dose of sunshine’, but ‘destroyed the image of anything beyond the
cell … The cell was blind … the window was simply to let in a formless smudge of
daylight’.138


Pentonville’s predecessors were not as comprehensively sealed from the world. Guy
Geltner argues that the ‘location, routine and permeability’ of medieval prisons meant
that ‘prison walls in the late Middle Ages did not describe the borders of a social
island’.139 This was still largely the case in eighteenth-century Britain. Indeed John
Howard recoiled at the extent to which free society permeated the prisons of the 1770s.
Visitors came and went. Prisoners, turnkeys and visitors could often only be
distinguished on the basis of who was in chains and who was not, and the state of their
clothes. Amongst prisoners much the same hierarchies pertained as those beyond the
walls—some lived in relative luxury while others dwelt in utter squalor. Howard was
horrified; what he wanted, in McGowen’s words, was a prison ‘less like the actual
world’.140


By the 1910s, in Australia as elsewhere, there was a yawning gulf between the prison and
the world, and now this was regarded as the problem. In 1918 the regular Bulletin
contributor J. H. M. Abbott described a typical Australian prison:


         A more or less imposing gateway, high surrounding walls, and ranges of cells
         geometrically built about flat yards. Everywhere spotless cleanliness, the smell of
         soap-suds and fresh paint and occasional flower-beds of a mathematical
         precision. Everywhere pallid men with scraggy beards … Everywhere uniformed
         warders, locked gates, steel bars and the jangle of keys. There is no scenery
         except the sky.141


At Emu Plains however, Abbot wrote, ‘you will see something different’. Young
prisoners were ‘out of the gaol atmosphere of the regular establishments’. The world and
the prison were visually re-connected:

distant buildings beyond the wall was believed to frustrate reform’. ‘The Well-Ordered Prison’, p.

        They are not shut out from the world by high walls. They can see that it is still a
        good place to be free in. They can look at it across green fields—which is a more
        inspiring way of looking at it than by means of mental processes that are limited
        to a recollection of conditions of life unbounded by a cell door.142


Prison camps represented a return to pre-penitential architecture in more than one way. In
addition to being relatively permeable institutions, they were often colonisations of pre-
existing, non-penal structures. Whereas the old gaols and houses of correction were
established in disused palaces and gatehouses, the Kirkconnell Afforestation Camp near
Bathurst, for instance, was established in an old country manor, Kirkconnell House (see
Figure 21). Other camps were created in old estates, lodges and farm buildings.143

    Ibid. In this, Abbott echoed other assessments of the Emu Plains Prison Farm. In 1915, the
SMH reported: ‘the gleam of the dawn and the early breeze that comes over the river are there to
cheer and inspire; stone walls give way to open space, with a background of rugged mountains, a
stretch of silvery water, a fringe of forest, and in the foreground comfortable farms, orchards and
cultivated paddocks, symbols of a life of peace and honest endeavour. These influences must
count in the remaking of men’. ‘On the Land. Farm and Station’, SMH, 26 October 1915.

According to James Kerr, of all the issues of prison design, the link to the world beyond
the prison has ‘probably been the most disputed and its loss by the prisoner the most
bitterly resented’.145 From the 1910s to the 1930s, Australian prison authorities became
increasingly persuaded of the importance of granting prisoners this sensory bond.


In 1935, prompted by the results of the camp system, the NSW Justice Minister Lewis
Martin proposed a modified version of the scheme for women prisoners. Martin felt this
required not only the removal of corruptible young offenders from the company of older,
debauched women, but a new sort of architecture. He proposed a ‘detention centre’
outside the walls of Long Bay. ‘Four brick walls and a sky above is not the proper
environment for prisoners,’ he said. In the centre, prisoners would be housed in ‘garden
huts’ and they would ‘look out on the ocean … and they will feel that there is a world
outside which is not completely shut off from them’.146


Oscar Wilde’s Ballad of Reading Gaol offers a glimpse of the significance to the prisoner
of what can be seen from the prison:


        I never saw a man who looked
        With such a wistful eye
        Upon that little tent of blue
        Which prisoners call the sky147


Palen Creek State Farm in Queensland was described as ‘the antithesis of Reading and all
it represents’. Prisoners certainly appreciated the differences between the two forms of
penal architecture; several wrote poems celebrating the absence of bars and walls.148 One
of the inmates at the Bombala Afforestation Camp in 1929 was Alberto Borri, an Italian
man serving a three-year sentence for breaking and entering. Throughout his

echoed those of Rebecca Ross, a one-time inmate at the State Reformatory at Long Bay. In 1910,
after her release she wrote of prisoners ‘seeing and knowing nothing of the outside world save the

imprisonment he corresponded regularly with his sister in Milan. In January, just after his
transfer to Bombala from Goulburn Prison, he wrote:


         To tell you the truth it seems to me as though I were free. What a difference in
         comparison to Goulburn. I am free all day and my cell is a small room with two
         windows and they close it at 9 o’clock PM when I go to sleep. I am right in the
         midst of forests … On Sundays and holidays I am allowed to go fishing and
         amuse myself as I like and I can remain in the open air. I feel 60% better and
         stronger.149


In 1960 the McLeod Prison Farm ceased to operate as a reformatory for prisoners under
indeterminate sentences, and received its first contingent of ordinary prisoners, one of
whom recorded his first impressions of the island. He and his fellows arrived still
sporting their ‘Pentridge Pallor’ and were all ‘very dubious as to the outcome of this
sudden change’, expecting a stockade of some sort.


         Instead we ushered into a pleasant dining room and served a delightful lunch …
         What a tremendous difference it makes to … breath good clean fresh air, instead
         of being confronted by those bleak, grey prison walls which unfortunately are a
         very significant part of our former abode. This camp is completely surrounded by
         towering pines trees, which provide quite an inspiring and heart warming sight,
         as well as supplying a very adequate shelter from any bad weather that may crop
         up … So far there have been only two complaints from the boys here; the
         mosquitoes and the complete absence of wine and women.150


Not all prisoners were impressed with the arrangements at prison camps. In 1956, an
inmate disgruntled at the disorganisation of the McLeod Prison Farm described it as ‘the
greatest open air circus in the Southern Hemisphere’. In 1963, Peter Wayne, an English
prisoner with over thirty years’ experience of incarceration, felt infantilised by them.
They were, he wrote

    ‘Impressions of French Island’, Neptune News, vol. 2, no. 4, 1960, p. 6, CVRC. Another French
Island inmate gave thanks for ‘the absence of the familiar blue-stone walls’ and the ‘opportunity to
look across the sea, the land; to listen to the birds sing; to see the sun rise and set; and to watch the
moon and stars at night’. Neptune News, August 1965, NLA.

        nothing more than metamorphosed army and air force camps, playing the game
        of crime and punishment with other people’s lives … Architecturally, we’re back
        in the 1940s … Peeling white flagpoles bend to the wind, and everywhere Nissen
        huts have been erected between trim lawns … Psychologically, the prisoner
        moves back to his childhood … He soon learns that within his apparent freedom,
        he must report here, there, everywhere, at impossibly difficult times, to a
        succession of different parades, roll calls, dining halls, workshops, welfare
        offices, wages huts, and even formally laid out kit inspections.151


However, most prisoners were willing to accept such restrictions in exchange for
escaping the crushing sense of isolation they felt in conventional prisons. In 1961, a
Victorian prisoner expressed his relief at arriving at the McLeod Settlement from
Pentridge: ‘The grim grey walls of Pentridge are more than just a measure of security,
they are in turn the resolute barrier between those confined inside and the society they
have wronged’.152 The NSW Cessnock Corrective Centre opened in 1976 as a sort of
intermediary prison between the camps and the secure prisons. ‘Eric’, one of the centre’s
first inmates, was impressed with the absence of ‘grim prison walls’. It was instead,


        defined by Cyclone fencing that in no way intimidates, affording instead an
        unobstructed view of surrounding landscape. Call it psychological if you like but
        there is no denying that it is definitely dispiriting to be isolated from nature for
        years on end. By being able to maintain visual contact with the free world
        prisoners are not made to feel like social rejects devoid of hope but have before
        their eyes the offering of an invitation to one day belong again.153

THE RETURN OF TOTAL ARCHITECTURE


For much of the twentieth century, this link with the world was regarded as inviolable,
even for dangerous prisoners serving long sentences. But at the same time that Cessnock
was under construction, so too was a new maximum security unit at Long Bay in Sydney.
Known as Katingal, this unit marked the unapologetic return of isolationist penal
architecture. In response to the rapid rise in the prison population and increasing unrest
through the 1950s and 1960s, prison administrators once again looked to a form of all-
encompassing architecture for solutions. A precursor to today’s ‘super-max’ prisons,
Katingal was designed to hold NSW’s most intractable prisoners, and to be operated
remotely. Architecture, augmented with electronics, enabled the prison to be controlled
without the need for any interaction between prisoners and guards. There was no natural
air or light in Katingal.155


The unit was controversial from the start, and it came in for special scrutiny during the
Nagle Royal Commission. In August 1976, in the witness box, Commissioner

154
   Contained in: Special Subject Batch: Palen Creek State Farm, 1931-57, QSA.
155
   NSW inmate ‘Russell C’ satirized conditions at Katingal, claiming he was ‘serving time at
present in the air conditioning duct at Katingal’. InPrint, February 1978, p. 7 (ML).

                                             115

McGeechan was forced to concede that living in Katingal was ‘rather like living in a
submarine’. Counsel assisting the Commission David Hunt asked McGeechan if it were


            desirable, in common humanity, that prisoners who may have to spend a large
            part or perhaps most of their lives in an establishment, from which they have no
            hope of getting out, should be able to see the sky and the surrounding
            countryside?156


McGeechan admitted ‘as an ideal, that is my belief’. Hunt then asked the commissioner if
he recognised the turn of phrase, ‘in common humanity’. The phrase had first been used
by Earl Mountbatten of Burma. In response to a rash of prison escapes in the United
Kingdom in the mid-1960s, Mountbatten was commissioned to inquire into the most
appropriate design for a new maximum security prison. He felt he could have
recommended that the prison be built with no windows at all, but he insisted that it was
‘desirable in common humanity’ that prisoners ‘should be able to see the sky and the
surrounding country’.157


In response to Hunt’s question, McGeechan acknowledged he had read Mountbatten’s
report whilst preparing the plans for Katingal. ‘So that notwithstanding, what was
strongly put forward by Lord Mountbatten as being necessary in common humanity’,
Hunt pressed on, ‘you approved of this submarine-like building?’ McGeechan replied that
Katingal was conceived of as ‘essentially a security custodian operation’ and, therefore,
prisoners needed to be prevented from signalling outside the prison from their cells or
dropping fishing lines from their windows, as a number of prisoners in Queensland had
recently done. When Hunt asked McGeechan whether the dangers posed by signals and
fishing lines trumped the demands of ‘common humanity’, the commissioner squirmed:


            McGeechan: Well, the 1976 view would be quite different, in my view, from the,
            probably, 1968, 1969 view.


            Hunt: How about the 1898 view expressed by Oscar Wilde, “I never saw a man
            who looked With such a wistful eye Upon that little tent of blue Which prisoners
            call the sky”?

                                              116

         McGeechan: Yes.


         Hunt: Well, it has been a fairly long-held belief.


         Nagle: What is desired in common humanity surely has not changed in ten years?


         McGeechan: No, your Honour, I was not attacking it on the basis of common
         humanity. I think I mentioned, if I may, that we had gone back to first principles
         to see where you could move to in terms of an on-going research programme to
         alter the concepts. Now the first principle was one of containment in custody, the
         overlays of psychiatrists and other experts coming into the area, and by those
         processes we were able to move to new positions from time to time.158


Justice Nagle then took over the questioning. If the first principle was security, why not,
he asked, ‘simply build a dungeon?’159 Katingal was de-commissioned on Nagle’s
recommendation, but in its brief history, it illustrates how tempting it is for prison
authorities, particularly in times of crisis, to see solutions in forms of total architecture,
despite the experiences of the past.160


‘The wheel of penal architectural fashion spins as fast as that of any other building type,
and, even more inevitably, ends up where it began’, James Kerr wrote.161 The last
governor of the McLeod Prison Farm gave nearly four decades of his life to the Victorian
prison service, long enough to see a full rotation. Shortly before he retired in 1975, he
called for increased use of cellular architecture. ‘The average prisoner’ he claimed,


         does not mind being locked away and many welcome it, in his cell a prisoner is
         free of the petty troubles he meets in his un-natural environment, and for a short
         time he can become his own man again.162

    John Morony had deep reservations about Katingal: ‘in treating people it is essential that other
people be used. How, for instance can any change in attitude be achieved by electronics? What
personal influence can be exerted by a computer or by a “dead-lock”?’ Morony, The More Things
Change, p. 665. For more on the balance between human and physical resources, see chapter nine.

The camps are part of a long cycle of responses to the challenge of how to arrange
prisoners and guards in penal space so as to balance order and humanity. Their story is an
important missing link between Pentonville and Katingal. Though faith ebbed in the
power of elaborate penal architecture to transform human character for the better, hope
that criminals might be reformed was not lost. That hope was vested in a genuinely
simple idea in architecture: structures that permitted human relationships and a
simulacrum of freedom. These structures ultimately disappointed too, but at least their
builders did not leave expensive monuments to misery, as did those who came before,
and after them.

                                   prison labour



                   There is probably not a more important problem for solution
                       in a prison system than the question of prison labour.
                                   William Darcy (1921)1




In 1962, the South Australian Gaols and Prisons Department published a pamphlet,
designed as a classroom teaching tool. A number of questions were included for
discussion:


        DO YOU THINK –


        (1) Mechanical equipment should be used in prison industry?


        (2) Heavy manual labour should be the rule?


        (3) That prison industrial training would help a man to reform?


        (4) That output is immaterial?2


If schoolchildren found these questions tricky, they were not alone. These same questions
have vexed and exercised the minds of administrators, politicians, prisoners, and trade
unionists for well over a century. While prison architecture determines the distribution of
individuals in penal space, there remains the question of what prisoners will do with their
time. Prison reform has been much influenced by the various responses proposed to this
question, often called the prison labour problem. William Gall, Darcy’s counterpart in

Queensland, thought prison labour was ‘one of the greatest difficulties of prison
administration’.3


In Australia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the prison labour problem
was a nest of contradictions. For a time, penal farming and penal forestry appeared to
offer an escape from these challenges. However, the range of reform options available to
administrators was significantly abbreviated by the politics of prison labour. Meanwhile,
farming and forestry came with their own, unanticipated sets of difficulties.




LABOUR, PRISONS, HISTORY


The German theorists, Georg Rusche and Otto Kirchheimer argued that historical changes
in penal systems reflect the changing demands of the labour market. Whereas earlier
penal historians paid little attention to economic issues, Rusche and Kirchheimer thought
the task at hand was ‘to study the historical relationship between criminal law and
economics, the history of class struggle’.4 The shifting balance between capital
punishment and incarceration, they argued, could be put down to fluctuations in the
labour market. Where a surplus of labour was available, capital punishment was
preferred. Where a scarcity of labour obtained, imprisonment became the preferred
sanction.


Rusche and Kirchheimer’s work had a strong influence on the revisionist historiography
of the 1970s. Foucault, for instance, thought pre-industrial punishment’s ‘contempt for
the body’, demonstrated ‘a system of production in which labour power, and therefore the
human body, has neither the utility nor the commercial value’ that they possess in an
industrial economy.5 With the rise of capitalism, prisons—with their workshops and rigid
time-discipline—became a way in which the state sought to extract the value and the
utility of human bodies.


Most historians of the prison now agree that Rusche and Kirchheimer overstated the
strength of the relationship between penal practices and changes in the labour market, and

post-revisionist historiography suggests that Foucault and others influenced by him
exaggerated ‘the role of the state and the penal sanction in particular in reproducing
exploitative capitalist social relations’.6 There is, as yet, no agreement on an alternative
model of the role of labour in penal change.


In his work on penal change in Queensland, John McGuire emphasised the importance of
the internal prison economy, and argued that the great imperative for prison authorities
was to minimise the fiscal burden of prisons on the state. The ‘labour market thesis has
thus far occupied too much historical space’, he wrote. ‘Historians need to do much more
work on the productive capacity of penal systems, and how this productive capacity
placed limits on the development of penal systems’.7 McGuire is right to suggest that the
dynamics of labour within the prison deserve attention. The history of the Australian
prison camps indicates, however, that links with the external economy remain an
important piece of the puzzle.


Rather than dispense with an analysis of the influence of the external labour market, ‘the
task at hand’ is to examine the relationship between the external and prison economies.
This, along with the trade union movement, played a significant role in determining
available prison reform options in Australia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Only within these constraints, once external economic interests had set
restrictions on prison labour, could administrators seriously consider the ways in which
they might use the productive capacities of the prisons to minimise the burden of the
penal system on the state.




THE RE-EMERGENCE OF WORK AS AN AGENT OF REFORM


Before we can consider the place of labour in the prison reform process in Australia in the
early twentieth century we must understand a little of the way in which labour has figured
in penological thought. As the early hopes for the penitentiary dimmed in the late
nineteenth century, labour assumed an increasingly important place in penological theory,
and the daily life of the prison. In place of silence, solitude and separation, work was

increasingly seen as the leading agent of reform.8 This is not to say that those who pinned
their hopes on architecture placed no value on prison labour. Prisoners worked in the cells
in penitentiaries on the Pentonville plan, and work was integral to the functioning of the
panopticon too.9 Similarly, those who championed the values of labour did not believe
architecture to be irrelevant. It was the relative emphases on architecture and work as
agents of reform that were changing.


By the 1910s, labour clearly trumped architecture in Australian penology. Prisoners
laboured in congregated workshops. In most states, task work had been done away with.
Previously, prisoners had been given set amounts of work per day, and could not be
ordered to do any more once that allotment had been completed. Around the turn of the
twentieth century, timed work increasingly became the norm, where prisoners could be
kept to a task for a certain length of time, regardless of how much work was actually
completed.10 In 1918, Samuel McCauley explained why the prisoners were no longer
subject to separate confinement during the final month of their sentence. This practice,
known as ‘the liberty stage’, was ‘introduced some years ago when the conditions
materially differed from what they are to-day’. The shrinking prison population,
combined with rising orders for prison manufactures made the liberty stage ‘most
inconvenient’.11 Instead of spending their final month of imprisonment in solitude
preparing for the temptations of the outside world, prisoners would be kept at work.


The rubric of work was a key plank in the penology on which prison camps were erected,
but in this, as in other ways, the camps were a return to earlier traditions of punishment.
Walter Crofton’s prison farm at Lusk was based on a belief in the corrective power of
productive labour, and so too was Harold Maclean’s original plan for Trial Bay. NSW
itself was founded on the idea that criminals must learn that those who would not work
would starve.12 But this thread runs further back. Before the Model Prison or the
colonisation of NSW, there were the Houses of Correction, or Bridewells, and it is to

them, Ignatieff argues, that ‘we should trace the germ of the idea of recasting the
character of the deviant’.13 The Bridewells did not aim to ‘reclaim lost souls’ as the
penitentiaries did later, but to demonstrate the principle that ‘obedience led to industry
which led to wealth’.14 The recasting was to be achieved by honest work, rather than by
specialised architecture.


Evans relates a story from the Rasphuis, the Dutch equivalent of a Bridewell, which
neatly illustrates the lessons such institutions sought to impart. A prisoner claiming to be
infirm was placed in a ‘water cellar’, which contained a conduit and a pump. Water was
then permitted to flow into the cellar through the conduit, filling the space. Eventually,
when the water rose high enough, the inmate, in panic, would pump with all his might for
as long as the water continued to flow, ‘until it was clear to everyone that his infirmity
had departed’. The cellar demonstrated


        the necessary and unremitting nature of work for the lower orders of mankind …
        If a person was lazy he was so because he had not perceived the indissoluble
        bond that connected labour with respite. Thus the water cellar could be said to
        prove a moral idea with the economy and precision of a proof in geometry. All
        forms of corrective discipline aspired to this concrete clarity.15


With the coming of the penitentiary in the early nineteenth century, the role of labour in
prison discipline receded, but only for a time.16 The increased emphasis on labour in
twentieth-century Australia represented a return to these older lines of thought about the
transformative power of work, albeit expressed in new terms. In the previous chapter we
saw how changing ideas about prison design coincided with a shift in penological
terminology. As cloistered structures fell from favour, less and less was heard of
‘reformation’, while ‘rehabilitation’ was increasingly spoken of. This shift was also

related to the re-emergence of work as an agent of reform. ‘Reformation’ suggested a
spiritual process. ‘Rehabilitation’ however, is closely related to both ‘habile’, meaning
competent, able and skilled, and to ‘ability’, and thus suggested industry and integration
rather than introspection and self-discipline.




THE PRISON LABOUR PROBLEM


There was a paradox in making prisoners work. ‘On the one hand’, the penologist Max
Grünhut observed:


         enforced labour has long been regarded as mere hardship, deliberately inflicted as
         a punishment proper … On the other hand, work is a much-coveted remedy
         which helps men to endure the unnatural state of captivity.17


Penologists noted that labour as punishment was an idea as old as the Bible.18 Labour was
certainly a punishment additional to imprisonment as far as the courts were concerned.
Prisoners sentenced to ‘hard labour’ or ‘penal servitude’ were theoretically receiving
more severe sentences than those who were to be merely confined, but these distinctions
meant little behind the walls.19


In any case, prisoners and penal authorities knew that the absence of work was the greater
punishment and, in Australia, authorities never suggested that prisoners be kept idle as a
matter of penological principle.20 ‘Labour is not by any means a punishment’ rather, ‘the
severest punishment is its deprivation’, William Gall wrote in 1923, as he expanded
agricultural operations at Queensland’s prisons.21 Depriving prisoners of work was not
only cruel and counter-productive, it could also be dangerous, according to the Western

‘Idleness or semi-idleness’ was the ‘the enemy of reform. It increases disciplinary
problems and lowers morale as well as encourages scheming and destructive plots’.22


If there was a firm consensus that the absence of work in prison was to be avoided, it was
just as widely accepted in the penological literature of the 1910s and 1920s that work
itself was a positive agent. In 1918, the Victorian ISB quoted from Mosby’s Causes and
Cures of Crime in their annual report: ‘Idle hands are the devil’s tools. Let us take from
the devil his tools. Close the devil’s workshop and you will close the prison doors’.23
Chief Justice Whistler Street made it sound simple when, after inspecting the Emu Plains
Prison Farm, he declared that ‘Work—honest work and plenty of it—is the panacea for a
good many evils in this world’.24


Despite the consensus, there was little agreement about the form the labour should take,
and finding enough was always a challenge. It was a topic, as Joseph Berkovits observes,
‘inherently controversial, and like the prison itself, a paradox’.25 Phillip Priestley’s
example of oakum picking in prisons in Victorian England neatly encapsulates the
contradictions and compromises of penal labour.26 Oakum was old tarred ship’s ropes,
often up to an inch thick. The work involved pulling apart the individual strands of the
rope. The separated strands were used to caulk wooden walls, or re-spun into rope. It was
hard, dirty, unprofitable, tedious work, and it was one of the major occupations of British
prisoners for decades (see Figure 24). Labour in Victorian prisons was conditioned by
three conflicting objectives: that it should be so hard as to be punitive, that it should
defray the cost of the prisoner’s incarceration, and that it should teach a useful trade, and
thereby reform the inmate. Oakum was an attempt to satisfy all these criteria, and it failed

on each count; ‘the old rope tied together a bundle of contradictions which were never to
be properly straightened out’.27 For some, it was not sufficiently hard to qualify as penal.
Never very profitable, the margins slimmed further as iron replaced timber in ship
construction. As the prison’s only competitor in the oakum picking trade was the
workhouse, there was moreover, next to no employment for prisoners who had become
proficient at the task. Nevertheless, oakum was picked because it required no machinery,
no training, and it could be performed in the cells. Above all, it did not interfere with free
enterprise. By virtue of these conveniences, British prisoners tugged at the tarry threads
for decades, keeping afloat ‘the leaky vessel of penal labour policy’ well into the
twentieth century.28

Oakum was, in fact, one of the more productive forms of prison labour in the United
Kingdom in the late nineteenth century. The other forms of work common in England in
the second half of the nineteenth century, such as the treadwheel, the crank and shot drill
produced literally nothing but pain and sweat (see Figure 25). Edmund Du Cane, the first
Chairman of the English Prison Commissioners, publicly admitted to ‘the unavoidable

uselessness of prison labour’.30 From time to time, British reformers called for prison
labour to be turned to some productive end. After all, they pointed out, the treadwheel
was originally designed to pump water or grind wheat. Such proposals were rejected on
the grounds that prisoners would find their punishment lightened if they knew some good
would come of their exertions.31 So prisoners on the wheel continued to ‘grind the wind’.
Many ‘climbed’ over 3500 metres per day, roughly the height of Mount Fuji.32 Although
critics protested the revolting, Sisyphean futility of the machine, it remained in favour
until the Gladstone report in 1895. But even after it was abolished, well into the twentieth
century, a hardness remained in the administration of British prison labour: ‘Many were
born to be hewers of wood and drawers of water’ wrote Prison Commissioner Alexander
Paterson.33

Prison labour in Australia


Oakum was never picked to any great extent in Australian prisons, and the Australian
colonies/states never fully shared the British enthusiasm for unproductive labour, but
similar tensions were at work.35 Farming and forestry may appear to have been more
rational responses to the prison labour problem, but the same contradictory pressures
were at work, and they were, like oakum picking, compromise solutions.


The Australian emphasis on productive labour was clear to foreign observers. Perhaps it
had something to do with the nature of colonial society. ‘The virtues and rewards of
industry were’, Ray Evans writes, ‘even more insistently proclaimed in a frontier
environment than within a well-established society’.36 NSW Sheriff Harold Maclean
thought the treadwheel ‘an odious form of useless labour’. After his appointment he
banned its use in the state’s prisons, consistent with his belief that prisons should be
‘industrious hives’ of labour.37 Neitenstein’s prisons made an impression on those
familiar with prison labour in the United Kingdom, such as Michael Davitt:


        Work is not made a mockery or torture, as it is with the treadmill and crank
        votaries here in England … It is rightly recognized that if any treatment can kill
        or lessen the evil practices of the criminal classes it is that which will induce or
        enforce habits of industry.38


Officials in other states were likewise unimpressed by pointless labour. In Western
Australia, J. M. Drew announced ‘The practice of setting men to useless labour merely as
an alternative to enforced idleness is another relic of the past’.39

different from the wheel or the crank to prisoners and reformers. This was especially true of
quarrying. In prisons like Yatala Labour Prison in South Australia, or Pentridge in Melbourne, the

The view that prisoners’ labour should be productive raised new questions. What should
prisoners produce? How should the goods be produced? How should they be sold? The
difficult, contradictory realities of prison industry ensured that there were no easy
answers to these questions.


Training a prisoner in a trade was thought to be the most effective way of ensuring he did
not return to prison. Gall thought it was ‘worth more to the prisoners than all the support
and succour of a benevolent society’, but teaching industrial pursuits in an age of
increasing mechanisation was a challenging proposition.40 Bootmaking and tailoring,
long-time staples of prison industry, were good case studies in the frustrations of prison
labour. When boots and clothes were still made mostly by hand, there was some value to
prisoners learning the rudiments of the trade in prison, but this value evaporated once the
industries were modernised; prisons were criticised for turning out prisoners skilled only
in hand-work.41 ‘The old time class of tailor has practically been crushed out’ of the
market by the mechanisation of the trade, William Gall noted, while prison tailoring
continued to be done by hand. The ex-prisoner found himself then with obsolete skills, in
addition to the stigma of imprisonment.42


When they were forced to admit that prison industry failed to impart the technical skills
necessary for modern factory work, officials fell back to vague platitudes. They claimed
that the aim was not to give the prisoner a thorough grounding in a trade, but at
introducing him ‘to the habit of industry’.43 This was little consolation for prisoners such
as Grant Hervey, who served time in several prisons in NSW in the 1910s and 1920s. He
dismissed the trades carried on in the conventional prisons, including bootmaking, on the
grounds that they were conducted with ‘stone age’ machinery and ‘antediluvian
methods’. Learning a trade under such conditions was achieved only at ‘the cost of the

destruction of the real factory-utility of a potential man … a prison-made artisan is no
artisan at all. He is simply a … hopeless bungler’.44


The difficulties with trade training did not extinguish the hope that prisons could be made
to ‘pay their way’.45 This prospect has long tantalised politicians and penologists alike. At
first glance it appeared absurd that a factory or workshop with a captive, unpaid, and
unorganised labour force could not turn a profit.46 Nevertheless, prisons returned
astronomical losses, even when the workshops were not actively sabotaged by
prisoners.47


In annual reports and other official documentation, bureaucrats went to imaginative
lengths to balance the books. This was usually done by attributing inflated value to all the
odd jobs prisoners performed, like sweeping the corridors, as if the department could or
would have employed outside labour to do these tasks if prisoners had not. Such sleights
of hand kept alive the hope that prisons could somehow be made self-supporting. William
Callaway, the Victorian Inspector General, was one of the few to admit essential
dishonesty of such calculations. They could, he said, ‘be arrived at only by the
inexperienced theorist or by the administrator who attaches imaginary value to the labour
performed in order to balance the accounts’.48


The books did not often balance, even with the benefit of creative arithmetic. Total
expenditure on prisons in Queensland in 1929, for instance, came to just over £40,000.
Gall credited the value of prison labour at around £27,000, but admitted that most of this
was derived from the values imputed to the basic maintenance tasks performed by
prisoners.49

The challenge of profitably disposing of prison industry products made the search for the
self-supporting prison particularly difficult. Industry demanded ex-prisoners be familiar
with modern machinery but did not want goods produced by prisons with such machinery
offered on the open market. The sole outlet for prison manufactories was then other
government departments, who were decidedly limited and unreliable buyers.50 In the
1890s for instance, many prisoners were left with little to do when the Melbourne City
Corporation stopped buying road metal from the Pentridge quarry, and the department
lost its contract to sew mail bags.51 Confounding matters further, officials knew that if up-
to-date machinery were installed in prison workshops, only a fraction of the prison
population would be needed to produce sufficient goods to meet government orders. Of
course, enough modern machinery could in theory be installed to occupy the entire prison
workforce, but then the quantity of goods produced would far exceed the capacity of
government institutions to absorb them, and—needless to say—the installation cost
would be exorbitant.




Prison labour and free labour


Many of the problems of prison labour might have been resolved if prisons were
permitted to sell on the open market. The famous British penologist, William Tallack
thought the prison labour problem was not one of too much competition, but of too little.
‘It is precisely because they have not already competed, in the ranks of honest industry,
that they have become criminals,’ he wrote in 1896. ‘And until they are induced, or
compelled thus to earn their livelihood, by labour, they will remain a far heavier tax upon
the public, than the very worst forms of industrial competition could involve’. Objections
to competitive prison industry were, he suggested, ‘penny wise and pound foolish’.52

   As historians and penologists have pointed out, the state-use solution is really a way of
camouflaging the continuing conflict with free labour and enterprise. Champions of the concept
failed to acknowledge that the withdrawal of the state as a customer from the market would have
the same negative effect on prices as the presence of prison products on the open market. See

History of the Prison, p. xii.

Few in the labour movement would have agreed with Tallack. Unions jealously protected
the interests of free workers wherever they perceived these rights to be threatened by
prison labour. McGuire argues that in contrast to the United States and England,
opposition to prison labour was ‘muted’ in Australia.53 The American experience was
admittedly extreme. In the early twentieth century, many of the states, particularly in the
northeast, were struggling to find outlets for productive prison labour acceptable to
unions and business. From 1895 to 1923 the rate of prisoner employment in prisons
dropped from seventy-two to fifty-two per cent as a result of a series of well organised
union campaigns. In 1931, one estimate put the rate of prisoner idleness as high as
seventy-five per cent.54 While the influence of the Australian unions was not so
pronounced, their opposition did lead to the demise of several prison labour projects.
Senior officials were, moreover, daunted by the prospect of union protest, and, as a result,
formulated policy cautiously.55


Union opposition to prison labour was awakened perhaps for the first time in Australia by
Henry Parkes’ 1861 Committee. The members floated the idea that prisoners could be put
to work quarrying stone for roadworks, from a site near Prospect. They felt such a
scheme would not ‘in any objectionable manner, bring prison labour into competition
with free workmen’. As A. W. Powell put it, ‘quarrying firms and their workmen
probably thought differently, since no more was heard of this plan’. Similarly, Powell
thought that one of the attractions of Maclean’s subsequent Trial Bay proposal was that it
could not be seen to interfere with free labour’s interests.56


Several proposals for the use of prison labour in the first three decades of the twentieth
century did not go ahead due to opposition from organised labour. In Victoria, Thomas
Bent’s efforts to extend prison industry were thwarted by the Labor opposition.57 An
erosion control program at Sandringham in 1924 was dropped, for the same reason.58 In
1927, the West Australian complained that ‘the pressure … of labour unions tends to limit
and even paralyse, prison industry’.59 In 1928, in response to a suggestion in Parliament

   ‘Prison Reform’, The West Australian, 24 June 1927. The positions of the various newspapers is
interesting. In NSW in the Neitenstein era, the newspapers that most vigorously championed the
cause of prison reform were the Daily Telegraph and the SMH. Those papers more sympathetic to

                                              132

that prison camps be used for public works, the NSW Justice Minister, Jack Lee said he
would ‘be glad to find more useful labour … If the organizations associated with
unionism would only permit him’.60 Less than a year later, unions forced Lee to abandon
a proposal to put maintenance confinees—men who had abandoned their families—to
work building roads.61


As we saw in chapter two, union opposition also contributed to the fate of the short-lived
road-making camp at Cowan Creek in Sydney. The Kuring-gai Chase trustees found
ready allies in the Australian Workers Union in their successful opposition to the
project.62 J. Bailey, the president of the NSW branch of the union thought the proposal
‘repugnant to Australian sentiment’. It was, he added,


         the thin end of the wedge to break down wages and conditions for that class of
         work. Of course there are no limits to the way in which Mr Lee might extend his
         scheme if he persists in using prison labour on work which should be given to the
         unemployed. He has adopted the best method of making enough criminals to do
         all the work that will be available.63


Even labour on proclaimed prison sites for specifically penal purposes could raise the ire
of organised labour. In December 1914, the Bricklayers’ Society complained to David
Hall, the Minister of Justice, about the use of prison labour on the construction of a large
wall around the Long Bay complex. W. Cahill, the president of the Society, added that he
hoped the prisons were not going to turn out ‘men half trained in a trade to compete when
they came out with those engaged in the industry. They would be a menace’. Prison

the trade union movement, such as The Bulletin and The Worker were notably silent on the issue;

Honours Thesis, University of NSW, 1968, p. 67.

61
   There were about 500 such prisoners in prison in NSW at the time, and they were not, Lee said,
truly criminal, but had simply been unable to meet obligations in difficult circumstances. The
original idea behind imprisoning such men was to make them work, and give the profit to their
families. Lee proposed using the confinees to build roads, and pointed out that as free labour could
or would not do the work otherwise, the scheme could actually lessen competition with free
enterprise by removing prisoners from the manufacturing industries. See: ‘Roadwork for
Maintenance Prisoners. Union Protest’, SMH, 5 March 1929; ‘Prison Camps for Habitual
Criminals’, SMH, 20 June 1929; ‘Use of Prison Labour. Suggestion to Government’, SMH, 3

    ‘Those Convict Hulks’, The Sun, 26 February 1930. Union opposition to prison labour is
greatest during periods of economic distress. Prison populations tend to rise in hard times, too. So
at the exact point when extra accommodation and labour are required, opposition is the greatest.

labour should instead be used to manufacture products not produced in Australia, such as
toys. ‘The interests of the free men should be considered first of all’.64 In the end, the wall
at Long Bay was built by prison labour, but the incident demonstrated just how few fields
of labour were ‘safe’ from union complaint, and highlighted difficulty, in practice, in
defining ‘state-use’. In response to a similar proposal put forward in 1930 by the
Victorian Chief Secretary, one labour leader suggested that if the government was serious
about using prison labour to save money, it ‘might try the experiment of selecting some
of the best-behaved prisoners to act in the capacity of officials, or possibly the Chief
Secretary’.65


In 1973, legal researcher Fiore Rinaldi was at a loss to explain why Australian
administrators were so concerned with ‘the essentially dead question’ of avoiding giving
offence to the labour movement.66 He claimed that no department of prisons or
corrections in Australia had been able to provide him with information about any specific
examples of union opposition to prison labour. The fact is, as the examples above
illustrate, unions have vigorously, and successfully, opposed many prison labour
projects.67 The departments have remembered the opposition, even if they have forgotten
the details.


Administrators around the world chafed at union interference, and raised high-minded but
ineffective protests. NSW and Queensland sent delegates to the Eighth International
Prison Congress, held at Washington in 1910, where the delegates agreed that ‘the outcry
against undue competition with free labour is to be condemned as inhuman’. The level of
competition offered private industry by prison labour ‘is so small as to be hardly
appreciable,’ they said, while adding that ‘all productivity from any source is a gain to the
community’. The delegates also claimed that ‘the importance of reforming prisoners by
labour outweighs all economic considerations’. These resolutions were based on ‘the law

of humanity, which cannot be attenuated even the case of a criminal’.68 These resolutions
were enthusiastically endorsed in Australia on several occasions.69


There is little evidence of what prisoners thought of the labour movement’s involvement
in prison reform. Some, at least, found it frustrating, if this Victorian prisoner’s remarks
are anything to go by:


        Unions generally would have us believe that they fight the use of prison labour
        on beyond the walls projects to protect the prisoner from a heartless exploiting
        bureaucracy … man to be a wholesome well integrated character must have a
        worthwhile and interesting job to perform … prisoners generally do not have jobs
        that are either interesting or remunerative, and this is no fault of the prison
        administration … If unions adopt a realistic and helpful attitude, if they will
        allow prisoners to be employed first of all in gaol on projects that will benefit
        them and then outside on projects that will help the community at large, then a
        new era in prison reform will be initiated … No union has ever shown real
        interest in prison work conditions or prison conditions generally. They only
        become concerned when their own vested interests are at stake, and then they
        rationalise that they are acting in the prisoners’ best interests.70




THE PRISON LABOUR PROBLEM AND CAMP LABOUR


The pressure to find work for prisoners that was productive, uncomplicated and free from
union interference pushed Australian prison systems steadily towards agriculture and

Others saw an inhumane logic in the labour movement’s position; one British critic thought ‘that
for the sake of avoiding the possibility of somebody, at some time, being injuriously affected in
some indefinite manner, they would doom their fellow-men to be kept at a degrading and useless
labour, or in enforced idleness’. Priestley, Victorian Prison Lives, p. 137.

forestry.71 In 1915, the Victorian Inspector-General William Callaway counted ‘the
prison farm movement’ among the ‘most significant developments’ in penology in recent
years, and expressed his belief that by this means ‘the prison labour problem would,
perhaps, most nearly find its solution’.72 In 1924, the Superintendent of Hobart Gaol
reported to his Attorney General on the question of prison labour:


         Prison Indoor Industries are generally unsatisfactory from almost every point of
         view. They are of the most elementary character, and are performed in a crude,
         amateurish way … In those countries where Prison Reform is receiving the most
         Scientific attention, it is generally recognised by experts that the most suitable
         form of work for prisoners is not Manual and Mechanical Labour done in
         workshops, but rather Open Air Employment on the Land … [this] POSSESSES
         GREATER POSSIBILITIES TOWARDS EFFICIENCY THAN ANY OTHER
         FORM OF PRISON LABOUR there is no reason why the employment of
         prisoners as Lumberers and Farmers in this State, should not be widely
         established.73


The fact that agriculture could be performed by prisoners without specialised skills
appealed strongly. Most of the prison population came, McCauley complained, from ‘the
ranks of the idle, dirty and thriftless … and is very unpromising material’.74 Most of these
prisoners also came to prison under sentences too short for any real training to be
provided. However, as McCauley noted, ‘the ordinary prisoner who lacks the required
skill or aptitude for a trade can render very good service at vegetable-raising, and with
some benefit to his health’.75 Inmates at Pardelup Prison Farm acquired, according to

that found prison farm labour to be seventy-five per cent as efficient as free farm labour, and
slightly more efficient than free labour when it came to forestry. Indoors, prison labour was said to
be between forty-five and sixty per cent as efficient as free labour. According to this research,
prisoner road-builders were also very nearly as efficient as free labourers but this option was not
considered by the Tasmanian authorities. See chapter two for more on the politics of road-making
by prisoners.

John Drew, ‘the training which in this country … is best calculated to help their progress
after release’76 At Hayes, prisoners with no experience in construction built piggeries
which housed animals that went on to top the market at the Derwent Park abbatoir.77
Agricultural skills also had the great advantage of not dating as quickly as industrial ones,
so officials felt that ex-inmates of prison farms would be more employable than those
released from conventional prisons.78 ‘Only last week’, the Tasmanian Controller, D.
Hornibrook proudly reported in August 1966:


        a former inmate [at Hayes] who completed a fairly lengthy sentence was engaged
        as a dairyman by one of the largest milk producers in the State. This prisoner had
        no knowledge of dairying prior to his transfer to the farm.79


Prison camps also presented an attractive solution to the dilemma concerning equipment.
In the mid-1910s, the wire-netting factory at Melbourne’s Pentridge Prison stood idle for
over a year, for want of orders, materials and spare parts.80 By contrast, writing of the
work being carried out at French Island in 1939, the Victorian Inspector-General Joseph
Akeroyd felt


        More could be done with up-to-date machinery and implements; but, as the main
        aim of this institution is the reformation of men, the hard manual labor is of
        utmost importance, and up-to-date machinery is not desired.81


Not only could prisoners learn useful skills without expensive machinery, the prison
population itself provided a steady ‘market’ for the produce.

In the early years, it seemed prisoners could work as productively as free labourers. The
forestry work on French Island in 1917 was ‘equal to that performed … by unskilled free
labour’, according to the Forests Department, which then promptly doubled the amount
per prisoner paid to the Penal Department.83 The NSW Prisons Department reported that
prisoners at Tuncurry in 1917 did ‘work … which compares favourably with that done by
free labour elsewhere’, and the local forester, Herbert Lyne, agreed that the work at
Tuncurry was ‘quite up to the standard of free labour’.84


The ex-prisoner Grant Hervey served time at the Tuncurry Afforestation Camp in the late
1910s and early 1920s, and he saw the productivity of prisoners there as proof that
neither criminals nor the prison system were beyond hope. He and his fellow inmates at
Tuncurry were not ‘employed in making boots on antiquated lines’ as they were at
Goulburn prison. Instead ‘they work like true pioneers, tearing down the wilderness with

the axe’.85 The men at Tuncurry, ‘worked like tigers’, but Hervey pointed out that they
were few compared with the bulk of the prison population.86


        There is an available working force … which a sane Government, instead of
        immuring behind hideous prison walls, where men learn everything that is bad,
        and nothing that is good, would use for the clearing of forests and the making of
        roads.87


In the 1910s and 1920s prison camps briefly seemed to offer, for the first time, a realistic
promise of self-supporting prisons.88 From the start it had been planned to make the
McLeod Settlement pay its way.89 In 1922, prompted by the economic returns of
Tuncurry and Emu Plains, the NSW Justice Minister Thomas Ley announced ‘it is
believed that the whole of the prisons could be made self-supporting’.90 At different
times, prison administrators believed that Palen Creek State Farm, Hayes Prison Farm,
the Kyeema Prison Camp and the Corriemungle Prison Camp were all in the black, or
nearly so.91


Finally, the fact that farmers lacked the organisation of industrial workers was not lost on
senior prisons department staff, or observers. The intransigence of labour, Blake
McKelvey argues, was the engine behind the establishment of many of the prison farms

in the United States in the early twentieth century.92 Agriculture was the one industry safe
from union protest. The American penologist Louis Robinson wrote: ‘in all this hue and
cry over unfair competition, nothing is said about farm products … but were farmers
organized we should doubtless hear from them more forcibly on the subject.’93


In NSW in 1898, Michael Davitt recognised agriculture as ‘the one form of industry
which least excites that very natural, but at the same time narrow and inconsiderate,
feeling of opposition to the competition of prison produce on the part of skilled
artisans’.94

thought those countries which came closest to solving the prison labour problem were those, such
as Switzerland, that had gone furthest with penal agriculture; ‘possibly because there has been less
organized opposition on the part of farmers’. Gillen speculated, however, that with ‘growing class-
consciousness’ farmers would soon raise serious and organised opposition to prison produce; see

In the 1910s, forestry, then in its infancy in Australia, was also safe from union protest.
No plantations were worked with private enterprise, and the cost of labour at the time was
too high for the work to be carried out by free labourers. Comptroller Steele thought the
establishment of Tuncurry was justified on economic grounds alone, as ‘a State asset’ had
been created ‘which would be too expensive with free labour’.96


In every state in the country, except Victoria, prison camps were introduced by Labor
governments, sensitive to the demands and the power of organised labour and less
concerned with the welfare of individual farmers. Where the camps produced surpluses,
they often sold the extra produce on local markets, to the unheeded chagrin of local
producers.97 In 1935, the NSW Prisons Department proudly announced that the Emu
Plains Prison Farm had made a profit ‘on pigs alone’.98 Angry letters from disgruntled
individual farmers did not have to be handled in the same way as public campaigns by
irate unionists.


Politicians and administrators of all political persuasions were well aware of the direction
in which they were pushed by the politics of labour. After he was forced to abandon his
road-making proposals, the conservative NSW Justice Minister Jack Lee admitted that
expanding the activities of the afforestation camps, including introducing more
agriculture, was the only alternative.99 In 1930, the South Australian CGP reported that
prison industries were not expanded during the year due to ‘the acute position of the
labour market … Relief from the position can best be brought about by the opening of a
farm or forestry camp’.100 In 1937, the Melbourne Herald applauded the government’s
plans for more prison camps. Noting that the labour movement had closed the open
market to prison produce, the paper added: ‘The objection to unfair competition with free
labour cannot be applied to work in the reclaiming of waste lands’.101

The widespread opposition to non-white labour in Australia made penal agriculture
particularly attractive. In the late nineteenth century white Australians were increasingly
anxious about the presence of Chinese migrants in the coming nation. At this time
Chinese growers controlled much of the market garden trade, up to seventy-five per cent
according to some estimates.102 Many white Australians were deeply uneasy at depending
so heavily on foreigners in this way.103 In New Zealand, prison farms had been
introduced, partly, in an attempt to break the Chinese near-monopoly on market
gardening.104


When the NSW Justice Minister David Hall was challenged by the bricklayers in 1914,
he stated that the only area in which the prisons genuinely competed with free labour was
agriculture. Emu Plains, as well as the farm at Long Bay, supplied the prison system with
produce that would otherwise have been bought on the market. Hall made no apology for
this. Indeed he hoped that the harvest might be increased to the point where all other
government institutions, including the hospitals, were supplied with fresh food from
prisoner-worked farms. ‘The market gardening was at present done mostly by Chinese,
and their numbers were decreasing’, he said.105 So comfortable was Hall with prison
industry competing with free enterprise in this manner, that he envisaged opening a shop
in the city to sell surplus produce from Emu Plains directly to the public.106 ‘The time is
very opportune’, Hall said in 1914, as he inspected prison farms in New Zealand:


        In the past our larger centres have been supplied almost entirely by Chinese. The
        White Australia policy is making Chinese labour scarce. There is ample demand
        for any vegetables we are able to grow without unduly interfering with vested
        interests.107


In light of the politics of race and labour, it can be seen that the establishment of the
prison camps was not as benevolent as most have claimed. While the benefits of penal

agriculture for both the prisoner and the state were widely catalogued, the effects on
growers elicited little concern. Without an effective voice as a group, their
interests—particularly those of the Chinese—were politically marginal and could be
ignored.108




THE LIMITATIONS OF CAMP LABOUR


The politics of labour and the re-emergence of work as an agent of reform funnelled
prison reform toward farming and forestry. In prison camps, administrators hoped they
had found the solution to the prison labour problem, and for a time, it seemed they had.
Prisoners at farms and camps worked hard, and largely without union complaint.
However, work at the camps was not without its own difficulties and challenges, and no
examination of the place of labour in the prison camp movement is complete without
considering these issues. Interestingly, these are entirely unacknowledged in the
literature. According to Ramsland for instance, forestry by prison labour at Tuncurry was
‘stunningly successful, both in terms of productivity and the moral and physical health of
prisoners’ and the quantity of work performed was ‘herculean’.109 Impressed by the
official rhetoric regarding the camps, Ramsland failed to notice the real problems with
labour experienced at the camps, problems that significantly diminished the camps in the
eyes of administrators.


Admittedly, prisoners at camp worked substantially harder than those in closed prisons,
particularly during the years just after the establishment of a camp. ‘It is amazing to note’
CGP William Hinchy marvelled in 1933, ‘the energy, initiative and capacity which many
of these men reveal in their work at the camps’.110 The Tasmanian Controller, John
Scanlan, said that one of the primary objectives of his department was to ‘train men to the




108
    Although administrators were content to squeeze the Chinese out of the market gardening
sector, they were glad to make use of their skills inside. In Pentridge, on the rare occasion a
Chinese gardener was admitted, a separate small plot of land was set aside for them, where they
were allowed to work undirected. In 1903, The Argus described one such prisoner ‘toiling with the
patient industry and extreme care of little things which is characteristic of his race’. The Governor
added: ‘We find these men of great service in the work of cultivation’. See ‘Farming at Pentridge’,
The Argus, 10 July 1903.

habit of work’. Those men ‘most receptive to this doctrine’ were sent to the farm, he said,
where the ‘results speak for themselves’.111


On any given day in Queensland in 1936, most prisoners at Boggo Road in Brisbane
would have done a few hours of light labour, or none at all. At Palen Creek prison farm,
on the other hand, the prisoners’ daily routine revolved around work:


        6.20 am prisoner rise
        6.30 am wash and dress
        6.45 am breakfast
        7.30 am roll call, march to labour
        11.50 am cease work, count, wash
        12 noon dinner
        1.00 pm roll call march to labour
        4.40 pm cease work, count, wash
        4.50 pm supper
        5.30 pm recreation
        8.00 pm roll call112


In the course of a single year, in addition to cultivating the fields, prisoners at Palen
Creek installed tanks, sank wells, built fences and roads, erected a laundry, a pump shed,
a piggery, a power house, a blacksmiths shop, a garage and a kitchen, and a woodwork
shop.113 At the Kyeema Prison Camp in the mid-1930s prisoners laboured at heavy
moving and grubbing. With no horses at camps, this work was done entirely by hand.114

Though the work was hard, it could be agreeable to the inmates. In the years before the
penal settlement was removed from St Helena, the prisoners tasked with the demolition
of the prison buildings were said to take pleasure in the work.116 In 1965 a prisoner at
Hayes was reported to have taken great satisfaction building a dam wall ten metres by
two and half metres. ‘He’s an artist with a bulldozer and has done a wonderful job’, said
Ron McCrickard, the farm’s overseer.117


No matter how vigorously inmates worked, or how much pleasure they took from their
tasks, camp labour was a mixed blessing, for inmates and the prisons systems in general.


Working in the bush or in the fields did present physical risks that prisoners in closed
institutions did not face. They were bitten by snakes, crushed by falling timber and
gashed by mis-swung axes and saws. Most camps possessed little or no on-site medical
facilities, and were some distance from the nearest hospital. In 1932, staff at Kyeema
Prison Camp were put in the awkward position of having to send for help to neighbouring
settlers when prisoners injured themselves, as none of the warders at camp had any

knowledge of first aid.118 During the wet season at Stone River State Farm in 1945, a
prisoner was sent with one warder to collect meat and bread from the Ingham post office.
Rising river levels forced the pair to take an alternative, mountainous route back to the
farm. The route was too precipitous for their horses, so they had to be left behind to be
collected later, when the waters receded. The route was so difficult, the warder reported,
‘that the prisoner narrowly escaped serious accident whilst crossing one of the flooded
gorges, losing the bag of bread in the process of saving himself’.119


Although injuries were common, fatalities were rare. Surviving records for the period
1913 – 1960 show only three deaths occurred at prison camps in Australia. One man
drowned in a river near Hayes Prison Farm in 1940.120 Another died at Bombala
Afforestation Camp in 1931. He was working in dense bush when a warder mistook him
for a kangaroo, and shot him, only weeks before he was to be released after seventeen
years in prison.121 A third died at Stone River prison farm in August 1956 of
Leptospirosis, a bacterial infection he caught by drinking water contaminated with animal
urine.122 These accidents notwithstanding, the death rate at camps compared to
conventional prisons was extremely low. It is a rare year when at least one prisoner does
not die in a conventional prison. Admittedly camp inmates were generally healthier than
inmates in closed prisons, but three recorded deaths, across nearly thirty institutions, in a
period of almost fifty years, is quite remarkable.123


Prisoners endured the risk and hardship of the work they were required to do, but they
also took to any number of unauthorised tasks with relish. Food is a perennial source of
discontent for prisoners, and while the dietary allowances were generally better than
those issued in closed prisons, food was still a contentious topic at the camps. Surrounded
by sheep, pigs, chickens and cows, and under light or non-existent supervision, prisoners
occasionally found themselves unable to resist temptation. At Hayes Prison Farm, for
instance, the prisoner-cook, was found with pork sandwiches, shortly after a

neighbouring farmer reported a missing pig. No pork had been issued at the farm for
months, so the cook had no choice but to admit the theft.124 Crops too could be, and were,
put to unauthorised uses. Prisoners regularly built simple stills and breweries and
produced various and often potent forms of moonshine—under the influence of which
many prisoners felt emboldened to escape.125


However, the greatest problems with labour at the camps arose from the management and
administration of the work. Most industries tailor the size of the workforce to the
demands of the work, but prisons staff had the unenviable task of fitting the job to the
workers, the number of which they had no control over. Officers at the camps were
constantly frustrated by fluctuating musters. Prisoners were transferred to and from camp
on the basis of their behaviour and/or the need to bolster or reduce numbers at other
institutions, and too many prisoners could be just as problematic as too few. Such
movements rarely matched the seasonal variations of farm or forestry work. ‘I could do
with many more men’, the exhausted OIC at Stone River State Farm complained in
1945.126 The same year the Western Australian CGP Alistair MacKillop reported that
numbers at the Pardelup Prison Farm had been increased so far beyond the farm’s
requirements that inmates were ‘on loan’ to dig potatoes for neighbouring settlers.127 By
harvest time however, Pardelup’s muster had dropped to the point where, in the words of
one of the officers there, it was ‘insufficient to maintain the Farm, let alone do any
improvements’.128


To make matters worse, officials had little influence over the quality of the labour at their
command. Many inmates, particularly in the second and third waves of the camp
movement, were unsatisfactory. ‘It is ludicrous to note the efforts of men introduced to

at least one occasion in 1968, staff and inmates at Morwell River Reafforestation Camp stole a

pick and shovel, crowbar and mattock for the first time after a life of indolence’.129 The
smooth operation of a camp hinged largely on having at least one or two prisoners who
knew something of agriculture. In 1924, Joseph Akeroyd admitted that the gardens at the
McLeod Settlement were in poor shape, as none of the staff on the island had any
experience in agriculture:


        As long as there is any industrious prisoner with a good knowledge of farming on
        the Settlement some good is done, but lacking such a man the consequences are
        disastrous not only from the point of the crops and rations but also morally.
        Slovenly and ignorant workmanship retards the recovery of self respect and has a
        deadening influence on the moral sense.130


Such problems became increasingly common after the war. In January 1948, the OIC at
Pardelup Prison Farm reported that ‘for the past two months many changes have taken
place with the labour at my disposal and this has an adverse effect in production’. The
recent transfer of two prisoners with dairying experience to the farm would, the officer
hoped, remedy the problem.131 At Stone River, the OIC repeatedly requested that he be
sent men with some skill at gardening or ploughing, as the prisoners they had were ‘a
very incapable lot, although in grubbing out stumps they are becoming very efficient’.132
Inmates with some talent in the kitchen were also greatly valued at camp. ‘I should be
glad if you could send me a cook as these men dislike doing it’, the OIC at Stone River
said in 1945.133 The labour of prisoners was so central to the workings of the camps that
officers sometimes lamented the days when good workers were due for release.134


Some types of prisoners were more suited to the work than others. Phil Hancox was one
of a number of conscientious objectors at Palen Creek during the Second World War. As
a group, they were set to work cutting sorghum and stacking it in the hayshed. After a

week, the manager said he had never seen the shed so full, and: ‘I don’t mind how many
conscientious objectors they send me’.135


Over time, guards and bureaucrats realised that when prisoners worked hard, they did it
not from a newly-learned love of ‘honest toil’, but because there were tangible and
immediate rewards for doing so. In most states, good industry earned prisoners greater
remission and earlier parole than in closed prisons. Problems emerged when this
incentive was removed, as an incident at Hayes Prison Farm in 1944 demonstrates. One
of the inmates at the farm at the time was D. R., who was serving a three-year sentence
for carnal knowledge of a girl under eighteen years. R. was by all accounts a good
worker, ‘the greatest little toiler that ever worked for me’, in the words of one his former
employers. Having spent nearly two years in prison, most of that time on the farm
working well, he applied for parole, with the encouragement of the farm’s overseer, Carl
Wilson. Controller Linton supported the application to the Attorney General, James
Macdonald, saying R.’s work at the farm was ‘particularly good’. Macdonald rejected the
application, stating that he regarded ‘a criminal of this description as being better in gaol
than out’. Rumblings of insubordination at the farm from both staff and prisoners
followed, and Wilson felt his position undermined:


        If no parole or remission is to be granted as a reward for extra good work and
        behaviour, it is here stated that the men will keep inside the letter of the law and
        will do enough to keep out of trouble only … What incentive is there for him to
        do more? … since this institution is Tasmania’s effort at prison reform, it follows
        that unless a man is induced to make this effort, he remains just as he came in,
        pays for his crime and goes out with an ‘account squared’ outlook.136


More troublingly, problems with labour at the camps were exacerbated by the fact that
the aims of productivity, good order and ‘rehabilitation’ each placed different demands
on the camps’ prisoners and officers. Experts from departments of agriculture and
forestry were regularly consulted in order to maximise productivity at the farms and
plantations, but they were generally reluctant to do more than offer advice in broad terms
unless they were given some authority in the management of the farms and plantations.

Where they had this control, tensions between land management and prison management
priorities were quickly exposed; where they had little or no influence over the work, it
was generally poorly done. Levels of control over labour and financial responsibility
were subjects of constant dispute between the departments. In its first few years of
operation, the NSW Departments of Agriculture and Prisons actually tussled for control
of Emu Plains Prison Farm, with unfortunate consequences for both productivity and
discipline. Officials from each department blamed each other for the situation.137


In Victoria, in 1924, tension boiled over between the Forests Commission and the Penal
Department over the management of the McLeod Settlement. For some time the two
departments had been at loggerheads over the quality of prisoners’ work, and security
concerns. Both departments maintained their own vessels for access to the island. On
several occasions escapees were found to have used the foresters’ boat to make their
getaway from the island.138 The forestry work was also not proceeding well.


A series of letters and meetings followed as the two departments tried to resolve the
issues. As a case study, this process offers an interesting glimpse into the logistical
challenges of running a farm and a plantation with prison labour. In a background memo,
Akeroyd divided the training given on the island into two types, practical and moral. He
felt reasonable progress was being made with the moral training, but he admitted to some
difficulties with the practical training. To that point, prisoners were handed over on a
daily basis to the two permanent foresters on the island, with a warder in attendance to
maintain discipline. This had led to ‘many cases of friction probably due to fault on both
sides’. In his personal diary Akeroyd was less circumspect; one of the foresters had
apparently been using prison labour to maintain his private residence on the island.139


Akeroyd suggested that his department take complete control of the work. His officers
had acquired some expertise in forestry work in their time on the island, or so he claimed.
Foresters could continue to inspect and advise, but ‘divided control is seldom

successful’.140 The idea did not find favour with H. Mackay, the Forests Commissioner.
He replied:


        When there was some difficulty in providing fit employment for all kinds of
        prisoners within walled prisons, I offered on several occasions to give a trial in
        forest work, to first offenders only at French Island … As time went on, this
        arrangement was altered without my consent, and confirmed criminals—men
        who had had several convictions—were sent to the island. This change did not
        improve the quality of the plantation.141


Mackay thought the plantation could be worked successfully if the supervision and
control were ‘of the right kind’. But given the defects of the site in terms of soil and
rainfall, he felt unskilled supervision would inevitably lead to ‘a costly failure’. The
commission could not, he insisted, ‘accept any responsibility without full control’.142
Akeroyd cared little for Mackay’s concerns. At Pentridge, the old wire netting works had
been burnt down by prisoners and were shortly to be replaced. ‘We are going to be faced
with modern machinery with the result that there will be no work to do at Pentridge’, he
told the Forests Commissioner.143 Akeroyd was desperate to find a way to absorb the
prison population’s energies and cared little about the finer points of forestry. He wanted
the foresters, and their troublesome boat, off the island.


Reluctantly and under pressure from the Chief Secretary, Mackay agreed to relinquish
control of the plantation. But his fears were borne out. Two years later, one of his officers
inspected the French Island plantings and found the trees in poor shape, choked with ti-
tree and acacia. At first the forester thought this could be put down to the soil, which
drained badly. But on closer inspection he found that ‘the actual conditions and methods
of planting have been at fault’. Young pines had been planted up to ten inches too deep,
or else with roots exposed. The system of firebreaks was also inadequate. He suggested
that all but a few isolated blocks be considered ‘virgin land’. The penal department

struggled on for more than a decade after this report, before finally admitting that the
plantation was a complete failure. It was abandoned without a single cut log having gone
to market. Moreover, escapes had continued in the absence of the forestry boat.144 Life on
the island without the foresters proved just as difficult as life with them.145


At Pardelup Prison Farm there was friction between foresters and prisons staff right from
the start. They disputed which costs were to be born by each department. The foresters
found themselves called on to fix the same problems again and again, and to respond to
urgent calls for help at decidedly inconvenient times. Fires broke out in the plantation,
apparently caused by negligent inmates. Kim Kessell, Western Australia’s chief forester
fumed: ‘apparently warnings to Inmates to be careful are not heeded’.146 New pines were
planted, but within only a few years were reported to be ‘a stunted, yellow and unhealthy
crop’.147 Those that grew well were eaten by rabbits.148 Frustrated by the work and by one
another, both departments were happy to neglect the plantation thereafter. From 1936,
forestry at Pardelup was a dead letter.


By 1939, penal plantations had been abandoned at the Tuncurry, Bombala, Kyeema, and
McLeod camps, as well as at Pardelup.149 This is, as a rule, because they were financial
disasters. The poor quality of the work and the extra costs associated with the penal staff
and infrastructure made many of the plantations cost just as much, if not more, than they
would have with free labour.

Unsurprisingly, given the manifold difficulties with prison agriculture and forestry, the
camps did not become self-supporting. The books did not balance, even when officials
fell back on their old techniques of creative accounting. H. C. Trethowan, the Western
Australian Under-Secretary for Justice reported in 1928, a year after the opening of
Pardelup Prison Farm, that the farm had made a loss of £1650. The ‘value’ of the
prisoners’ labour, he hastened to add, reduced the loss to a mere £290.151 In other words,
if free labour had been paid to do the work, the system would have been even more
unprofitable. Despite Trethowan’s repeated reassurances that the farm would soon show a
real profit, the operating loss actually increased. ‘It might reasonably be thought that a
farm provided with adequate labour receiving little or no wages should show a handsome
profit,’ he admitted. Most of the loss he put down to the unusual costs on the balance
sheet, such as officers salaries, transport and food, and the rest he attributed to the quality
of the labour: ‘the labour value of the average prisoner is a great deal less than that of the
average farm labourer’.152

As it became clear that the camps’ productive capacity had been exaggerated, penal
bureaucrats were increasingly forced to defend their experiments on purely penological
grounds. Alaistair MacKillop justified the expense of the Pardelup Prison Farm on the
grounds that it offered ‘something which cannot be measured in pounds, shillings and
pence’.153 In Victoria, Akeroyd maintained that


        too much attention must not be given to profits won or losses sustained … nor
        can it be argued that a prison system as a whole can be made to pay. The main
        aim of any prison system is the re-making of men, the making of spiritual, not
        monetary profits.154


Likewise, in 1954 Rutherford insisted that the dollar value of Queensland’s State Farms
could not ‘be calculated as it deals in human values and the frequent restoration of men to
society and their families’.155


Falling back on the language of rehabilitation was risky business, though. As Thomas and
Stewart argue, ‘the economic argument is the only one which encourages modification of
those reactionary attitudes which constantly confront the reformer’.156 Moreover, the
economic work and penological work carried out at the camps could not be so easily
separated; administrators acknowledged that the camps that worked best as prisons were
those very few that worked well as farms or plantations.157 And by this time, as we shall
see in the next chapter, the rehabilitative capacity of the camps was also in question.

CONCLUSION


On his first day as Inspector General of Prisons in Victoria, Joseph Akeroyd wrote in his
diary: ‘Took charge of Penal Dept. The difficulty of obtaining good work is obvious’.158
It was a perennial problem for prison managers. They were anxious to use prisoners’
productive capacities to minimise the financial burden the prisons placed on the state, but
the demands of politicians, the public, prisoners and trade unionists created such a dense
network of problems and prohibitions that administrators had scant latitude for action.
They chose the path of least resistance, and the few who may have objected were
marginal or disorganised.


Farming and forestry were not, however, entirely satisfactory solutions and both gave rise
to new problems. The work presented physical risks. The authorities could do little to
prevent crops and farm equipment from being used for unauthorised purposes. The size
and the quality of the workforce at each camp often bore little relation to the demands of
the work at hand. Indeed, foresters, agronomists and penal bureaucrats found it difficult
to agree what the demands of the work were. Experience at the camps showed that
running a farm or a plantation productively could often mean using inmates to meet the
institution’s needs, rather than the other way around. Finally, despite the hopes they
raised, the camps failed to break even.


Some of problems stemmed from the physical nature of the work at camp, and some from
the workers, but the central problem was that labour itself was not as straight-forwardly
‘good’ for prisoners as the reformers had hoped. Penologists had long argued productive
work was naturally reformative, but in reality, it was a complex and frustrating part of
prison life.


By the time it became clear that the camps would not solve the prison labour problem, the
relationship between labour and penology was changing again. Faith in the power of
work as an agent of reform was on the wane once more. ‘There may be no perfect
solution’, John Morony wrote in 1961, adding: ‘It is probably better to look at the
problem simply as a problem to be worked on’.159

                              Cultivating Reform:
                        Landscape and Penal Change



    This excellent combination of forestry & prison management means the killing of two
     birds with one stone—the birds being unproductive lands & criminal proclivities.
                  H. M. Vaughan, Attorney-General of South Australia (1917)1


Modern penal institutions exist, putatively, to transform the people held within them into
law-abiding citizens. One of the ways in which the prison camps were seen to do this was
by tapping into potent ideas about the power of the cultivated landscape to change human
behaviour. However, they were part of a project to transform landscapes as well, and
indeed the two processes were linked. The camps can be read as part of an effort to create
a moral landscape that encompassed both the city and the hinterlands. Tuncurry, the
original camp and the model for many that followed, illuminates the way in which penal
reform in the early twentieth century became entangled in grand dreams for the
Australian landscape.




REDEMPTIVE AGRARIANISM


The link in Western thought between moral qualities and the cultivated landscape dates
back at least as far as scripture: before the fall, the earth put forth its bounty of its own
accord, without the need for human intervention. After the fall, Adam must mix his
labour with the earth to work out his salvation.2 In the British tradition, agrarianism came
to be expressed in terms of what came to be called the ‘yeoman ideal’. In 1782, William
Ogilvie, a Professor at King's College, Aberdeen, succinctly summed up the concept:


         Men employed in cultivating the soil … are of simpler manners, and more
         virtuous, honest dispositions, than any other class of men … That every

            individual who would choose it should be the proprietor of a field, and employed
            in its cultivation, is most favourable to happiness, and to virtue.3


The notion of ‘redemptive agrarianism’ has from time to time, as John Ramsland has
observed ‘proved irresistible’ to penal reformers around the world.4 Indeed an early link
between agrarianism and penal policy can be seen in the colonisation of NSW for penal
purposes in the late eighteenth century.5 The prominent pastoralist John Macarthur, for
one, felt that ‘the labors which are connected with the tillage of the earth, and the rearing
and care of Sheep and Cattle, are but calculated to lead to the Correction of … vicious
habits’.6


Much the same idea pervades John Glover’s famous painting, ‘Harvest Home’, painted in
1835, in which red-jacketed convicts redeem themselves in making and working a golden
agrarian landscape. (See Figure 31).


As Macarthur’s remarks and Glover’s image suggest, agricultural labour was prized for
moral effects whether or not those who performed it owned the land, or just worked it. As
Joseph Powell has observed, throughout Australian history, the land has loomed as ‘a
perennial, omnipotent panacea’.7

It is possible to read the prison camps as an another exercise in institutionalised
redemptive agrarianism and, indirectly, as another attempt in the long series of (mostly
failed) efforts to establish an Australian yeomanry.9 ‘To employ men in tilling the land
and caring for its products,’ wrote a reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald of the
newly-established Emu Plains prison farm, ‘is to meet the potent call that is within almost
all men to get into closer touch with Mother Nature’.10 At the opening of the Tuncurry
camp, William Holman declared his hope that inmates would ‘be given a taste for
agricultural work’, and that they would ultimately become ‘landholders on a small scale.
A new life will be opened to them’.11 The Western Australian Governor, Sir William

Campion, was present at the opening of the Pardelup Prison Farm in 1928, and he told the
men: ‘you will enjoy many of the advantages of a country life, in fitting yourself for the
future’.12


When new lives opened for prisoners away from the city, the authorities’ satisfaction was
palpable. In 1923, Samuel Mauger reported the case of ‘a young fellow’ who had spent
time at the Castlemaine prison farm after an early career as a housebreaker. He had
married, and


         is happily settled in his home on the outskirts of a certain city; keeps his own cow
         and poultry, and is thus reaping the result of his farm experience at Castlemaine.
         He … considers his conviction and detention at Castlemaine as the best thing that
         ever happened to him.13


There is a clear note of satisfaction in the letter R. W. Robinson of the Prisoners Aid
Association of NSW wrote to the OIC at Bombala in 1931 regarding the imminent
discharge of prisoner R. M.: ‘The prisoner requested “a tent and blankets on release” as
he stated he wishes “to go to the country.”14


The agrarian ideal remained a powerful framing device in the discourse around penal
labour even into the second half of the twentieth century. According to material prepared
in 1963 for the opening of the Karnet Rehabilitation Centre—a prison farm in the
Keybrook State Forest, south of Perth—inmates would learn ‘the way of life of a man on
the land’.15 Beneath a photograph of an empty field appear the lines:

         The Road Back16


Connecting agricultural labour with both religious and secular redemption, the pamphlet
continues: ‘the man is close to God who is close to the good earth’. Even at this late stage
the language of pioneering could be evoked: ‘To the inmate the task of helping to create
from virgin bushland and swamp, flourishing gardens and smiling pastures’.17


What the prisoners thought of such purple sentiment is hard to know. Some, like James
Dawson, were inspired to take up lives on the land after their discharge. Dawson was
released from the Emu Plains Prison Farm in 1949, after serving only two and a half
years of a ten-year sentence for a crime of violence. ‘I really think I’ve seen the light’, he
said as he declared his intent to settle on the land, and establish a chicken farm. He added
that his time at Emu Plains was:


         the best part of my imprisonment … I spent most of my spare time with the
         chickens—cross breeding and studying them. It was fascinating work … I’ve
         always wanted to go on the land, and after spending two and a half years in gaol
         I’ve become used to a quiet life.18


Cases like Dawson’s notwithstanding, it is probably safe to assume that many prisoners
were sceptical about the effect that their time as captive farmers would have on their
futures. For Darcy Dugan, the landscape at Mannus Prison Camp was simply a soothing
relief after the rigors and deprivations of Grafton Gaol. ‘Nothing pleased him more than
to see the night sky awash with stars, and sun rise and set within the panorama of the
forest’. The experience inspired Dugan to try his hand at painting the landscape, but he
cared little for working it.19


In the early 1960s, the gunman, Frederick ‘Chow’ Hayes was confined at the Kirkconnell
Afforestation Camp, where he had charge of the garden, and he too was nonplussed by

farmed landscape as a site of labour; see, for instance, letter by prisoner Alberto Borri, 26 January
1929, ‘Files of Two Prisoners, State Penitentiary Long Bay, 1928-29, SRNSW 3/3210.2, and the

the claims made about the consequence of his labour. Visitors to the camp were usually
eager to meet the infamous criminal, to Hayes’ bemusement:


        The prison bosses would describe how I was in charge of the garden—when I
        didn’t know a weed from a flower—and continue to boast how well prison farms
        worked, and how this notorious gunman was now running the garden and so on.20




REDEEMING THE CITY


John Ramsland interpreted the NSW camps as an example of redemptive agrarianism in
action. They had, he writes, ‘their philosophical roots in the agrarian moral rescue myths’
of the nineteenth century, and were modelled on the Agricultural Colony at Mettray. Like
the French reformatory, the camps were designed so that the ‘the prisoners would be
morally restored to a respectable law-abiding life by being brought close to nature’.21
However, there is more to the story: the camps aimed to redeem fallen landscapes as well
as fallen individuals—and not just the rural hinterland, but the cityscape as well.


The camps were part of a project to transform cities in two ways. One was to shift
troublesome individuals out of the city, which itself was increasingly seen as a breeding
ground for moral contagion. Rapid urban growth in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries provoked fears about the social consequences of excessive urban
concentration—poor hygiene, unemployment, larrikinism, emasculated breadwinners,
wayward children, low birth rates, and even the degeneration of the white race.22



20
   David Hickie, Chow Hayes: Gunman, Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1990, p. 308. The rhetoric
of redemptive agrarianism was certainly overblown at times, In South Africa, Alan Paton came to
this conclusion based on his experience at the Diepkloof Reformatory: ‘There was a theory—not
unknown in other countries—that the land exercised some mystical influence on juvenile
offenders. This theory could be carried to absurd lengths, and continued to be held even when
more than ninety percent of juvenile offenders placed on the land ran away from it to get back to
the lights and sounds of the city’. Alan Paton, Towards the Mountain: An Autobiography, Oxford

Along with schemes such as closer settlement, the village movement and the new
national parks, the camps were a response to the ills—real and perceived—of
urbanisation. From the start, they were praised for their success in preventing ‘the
aggregation of prisoners in the cities and towns, where … they often revert to crime’.23
One writer full of praise for the Emu Plains Prison Farm stated:


        Boys who are sent to the farm are accustomed to knocking about the street corner
        where they develop larrikinism. At Emu Plains mother earth takes a part. The
        boys see nature at work in the growth of the trees and the crops, and they obtain a
        different view on life.24


In 1938, social reformer Jack Creagh argued that there was ‘health, wealth and future
prosperity for many city failures if we can properly train them, not only to put in their
time on farms as prisoners, but to take up land and work for their future’.25 Prison
officials—and district foresters at the afforestation camps—agreed, and actively sought
work for discharged inmates in the localities in which the camps were situated.26


The second way in which urban environments were changed by the camps involved a
process that began in the late nineteenth century which John Pratt has called ‘the
disappearance of the prison’. The penitentiaries of the early nineteenth century were
located in the heart of metropolitan centres and were ‘some of the largest, most expensive
and most technologically advanced buildings then in existence’.27 From the late
nineteenth century, the sight of prisons and prisoners in public space became acutely
embarrassing, and reformers, prisoners, and penologists agreed that inmates and free
citizens were degraded by being exposed to each other’s sight.28 In an earlier work, Pratt
observed that in New Zealand, there grew a ‘feeling of antipathy—not to say

revulsion—at the public presence and visibility of the prison itself’.29 According to one
public figure, the urban prison was ‘like a man having a rubbish heap on his front lawn’.30
The visibility of the early penitentiary had been deemed an important, salutary reminder
of the grim consequences of sin; later prisons became increasingly invisible to city-
dwellers: ‘camouflaged, anonymised, hidden away in remote, outlying areas of the
modern world’.31


In Australia, from the turn of the twentieth century, a concerted push was mounted to
clear the city of penal institutions. By this time, Darlinghurst Gaol—which was once on
Sydney’s outskirts—was seen as an obsolete ‘social blot’ on the city. A royal commission
had argued strongly that the gaol was ‘an obstacle in the path of city improvement’.
Observers also thought the location unnecessarily cruel on prisoners.32 Michael Davitt,
after inspecting Darlinghurst, said ‘why, the curse of Tantalus was nothing compared
with the mockery—the cruel, relentless, persistent mockery—of all this life, liberty and
laughter all around’.33


Penal institutions were forced into a retreat. In 1911, the Sobraon, a training ship for
juvenile delinquents which had been moored at Cockatoo Island, was decommissioned
and the inmates moved to the Carpentarian Reformatory for Boys near Eastwood.34 In
1914, a year after the opening of the camp at Tuncurry, Darlinghurst Gaol was finally
closed, replaced by the new State Penitentiary at Long Bay, then a sparsely populated
area on Sydney’s coastal fringe.35 As cities expanded and surrounded formerly outlying
penal institutions, pressure again mounted for their closure or removal. No one wanted
prisoners as neighbours.36 When the prison could retreat no further, authorities disguised
it with bland modern architecture and gentle landscaping.

   The training ships had been in decline since 1905, when changes in juvenile justice policy meant
that young delinquents and orphans were increasingly sent to the Reformatory (popularly known
as the Brush Farm Home for Boys). Established in 1894, the Reformatory itself closed in 1913; the
site was deemed too small and too close to the expanding city. It was replaced by the larger and
more distant Farm Home for Boys, Gosford. Gregory A. Cartan, Farm Home for Boys, Gosford:

   By mid-century, Long Bay was well within Sydney’s suburban reach, and its neighbours called
for the still relatively new prison to be moved. Vince Kelly, ‘Long Bay. People want gaol moved’,

The prison camps were an important part of this project to erase the visible signs of the
penal system. Almost all the camps were located well out of sight of urban centres. And
the camp at Cowan Creek failed, in part, because of its proximity to the city, despite
being based on the same penological principals as the afforestation camps.37 The
Australian public, or at least those who lived in the cities, wanted justice done, but
increasingly did not want to witness its workings.




REDEEMING THE LAND


The object of the agricultural colony at Mettray had been, according to Fréderic-Auguste
Demetz, one of its founders and directors, ‘to improve the boy by the earth and the earth
by the boy’.38 Those who have written on the Australian prison camps have noticed the
effort to change the inmates by the earth, but they have not considered the ways in which
the natural environment was transformed through prison labour.39


For early twentieth century politicians, citizens and journalists, there was something
compelling in the spectacle of criminals cultivating a former wasteland—something more
than just useful, healthy labour. The land on which the garden at Parramatta Gaol was
established around 1910 was ‘a bare, beaten down yard and about as suitable for plant
growth as a macadamised road’. The soil, peppered with gravel and pipeclay over a bed
of sandstone was ‘about the last description of country likely to be chosen for a market

The Sun, 18 September 1957. Melbournians too, chafed against the presence of the prison.
Residents and aldermen of Pentridge repeatedly campaigned to have the great bluestone prison in
their midst moved (indeed for some time it was planned to shift the prison to French Island).
Although these calls fell on deaf ears, they did succeed in changing the name of their suburb to
Coburg, to dissociate the neighbourhood from its most infamous landmark; see Richard Broome,
Coburg: Between Two Creeks, Coburg Historical Society, Melbourne, 2001, pp. 273-75. See also

   Those who have written on prison farms overseas have also seen the environmental
transformations these institutions created as of only passing interest. For example, the Witzwil
Correctional Colony in Switzerland was established in 1895 on a peat moor on the southeastern
side of the Neuenburger Lake at the feet of the Jura Mountains. ‘In the redemption of a swamp’,
the American penologist John Lewis Gillin wrote, ‘the redemption of Swiss vagrants, petty
criminals, alcoholics and ne’er-do-wells was the main object’. See John Lewis Gillin, Taming the
Criminal: Adventures in Penology, Patterson Smith, Montclair, 1969 (orig. publ. 1931), p. 166.

garden’, but years of labour successfully turned the ‘miserable tract of land into a most
productive and valuable garden’, despite the inherent limitations of the workforce.
According to Walter Campbell, the former NSW Director of Agriculture, in ‘bringing this
waste land under subjection’ a remarkable feat had been achieved.40 Likewise, in 1916,
the Reverend Arthur Morris, a chaplain to the State Penitentiary at Long Bay marvelled at
how the prison grounds were ‘being turned from a desert of sand to a huge and productive
garden’.41


At camp, the toil was even more exacting. Prisoners were often called to perform the
work of pioneers. They hacked back the wilderness, often in mountainous or scrubby
country. They felled thousands of hectares of native forest, drained swamps, moved rocks
and burnt scrub. They erected fences, dug ditches and irrigation canals, and built roads,
dams and bridges. Later they created and maintained agricultural landscapes, sowing and
reaping crops, running livestock, planting seedlings, pruning saplings and picking fruit.
They grew flowers and raised vegetables. They raised and demolished buildings. And
they fought back threats to the landscapes they had created—chipping out weeds,
trapping and poisoning rabbits, fighting fires.42 Indeed, prisoners formed the most
effective fire-fighting units in their districts. In 1939, inmates at the Mannus prison camp
were largely responsible for saving the town of Tumbarumba from bushfire, and
properties near several other camps were also saved by prisoner-firefighters.43 These
efforts earned the prisoners shorter sentences and the gratitude of their neighbours
(including those who had been opposed to the establishment of the camps in the first
instance).44 Some camps also doubled as fire-watch stations for forestry commissions in
the summer months, though prisoners could of course start fires, as well as fight them.45

For the most part, the farms and the plantations attached to the camps did not do well.
This was for a range of reasons, as we saw in chapter four, but a key cause was that most
camps were established on poor country. At Tuncurry the soil was sandy and infertile, at
the McLeod Settlement it was thin and badly drained, and at Kyeema and Stone River it
was rocky, wet and unproductive.47 Pardelup was well suited to crops and livestock, but



South Australian CGP H. Whittle was so anxious to establish and maintain good relations with the
landowners surrounding the Kyeema Prison Camp that on at least one occasion he elected not to
forward information to the police regarding the cause of a bushfire fearing that it might lead to a
criminal prosecution (see Whittle to OIC, Kyeema Prison Camp, 14 April 1933, Letter Books,

not to forestry.48 Whitinbah was closed because the site turned out to be unsuitable for
dairying.49 Tellingly, the few camps established on good land—such as those at Hayes
and Emu Plains—were often those that lasted the longest and were regarded as the most
successful.50


Productive or not, most camps had significant and often unexpected impacts on the
landscapes they occupied. They created unusually large population clusters for farm and
forest country. This was partly why they made good firefighting units, but it made the
camps useful in other ways too.


At the Mannus Afforestation Camp in the southern tablelands of NSW, prisoners
maintained a pine forest as an experimental form of weed control. The old Mannus
pastoral estate had been subdivided for soldier settlers after the First World War, but in
less than a decade the settlers were driven out by a severe infestation of St John’s wort, or
Hypericum perforatum.51 A perennial with bright yellow flowers, the wort had been
introduced to Victoria from England in the 1850s as an ornamental garden plant. Despite
its traditional use as a ward against evil and its more modern application as a remedy for
depression, it was, as far as the solider settlers were concerned, a serious evil and the
source of much despair.52 Spread by rabbits, travelling stock and waterways, the wort
proliferated across southeast Australia. It was a nightmare for farmers, and worse for their
livestock, in which it caused terrible dermatological problems. In large quantities it also
acted on the central nervous systems of the sheep and cattle, causing them to become
depressed or even manic. In 1925, the NSW Surveyor General declared that ‘excluding
the prickly-pear development … it may safely be said that no more serious menace exists
than that threatened by the growing development of St John’s Wort’.53

Foresters had for some time suspected that the wort could be controlled through
afforestation. Fast-growing conifers would quickly form a canopy; the wort, deprived of
light, would be suppressed and eventually die. In 1926 the NSW Forestry Commission
established a plantation at Mannus to test the theory, but the costs associated with the
project quickly spiralled out of control and the commission raised the possibility of
placing a prison camp on the site.54 In 1930, Justice Minister, Jack Lee, approved the
plan, after he was forced to abandon his plans for Cowan Creek.55


The prison labour force at the McLeod Settlement was used to fend off a different
biological threat in the mid-1960s. One of the first outbreaks of the sirex wasp on the
Australian mainland was identified in the French Island pine plantations. The sirex wasp,
or horntail, is a wood boring insect of the Siricidae family native to the conifer forests of
the northern hemisphere. Pinus radiata is particularly susceptible to horntail
infestation—in it the wasp bores deep tunnels and spreads wood-rotting fungi.56 In 1965
P. radiata accounted for more than half of the 200,000 hectares under pine in Australia.
So when the wasp was identified in P. radiata in the island’s plantation, forestry officials
took the matter very seriously. The prisoners were given the job of eradicating it, and
according to ‘Jim Mc’, the prisoner-foreman leading the ‘general gang v the sirex wasp’,
it was grueling, and somewhat baffling work:


         the General Gang faces the formidable task of falling and burning the trees
         affected. These cover many acres … Equipped with axes, mattocks and a chain-
         saw, the Gang has been consistently thwarted in its operations by recent heavy
         rains; making for muddy conditions underfoot plus the frustrating experience of
         attempting to burn rain-soaked timber … it seems incredible that the mere
         presence of so small an insect could warrant the wholesale destruction of a pine
         forest.57

The outbreak was eventually brought under control and the wasp repelled, but ironically,
French Island’s pine trees later turned biological invaders. As well as P. radiata, the
prisoners also planted P. pinaster. Little was done to stop the trees spreading into the
surrounding native vegetation, which P. pinaster did, aggressively. It colonised the island
so successfully that a control strategy had to be formulated for the pines.59


At some camps, the ways in which landscapes were transformed had profound social
implications. We have—in chapter two—seen how the Emu Plains Prison Farm was
celebrated, in part, because it was seen to have exorcised the ghosts of the old penal farm,
and the convict system it stood for. By contrast, in the Tumut region in the south of
NSW, prisoners from the Mannus and Leslie Nott prison camps worked Forestry
Commission plantations that eradicated the old pastoral landscape and its communities.
Many of the district’s settlers were bought out by the commission, and those who
remained felt increasingly isolated. ‘Once they had other families as neighbours’, but the
plantations were worked by commuters from distant towns, or by a transient pool of

prisoners. Familiar landmarks and their names, known to locals since their childhoods,
were obliterated by the uniform, numbered swathes of pine. According to oral historian
Ruth Lane, ‘the change from pastoralism to pine plantations … effectively restarted the
region’s history from year zero’.60




FIRE, SAND AND TREES OF GOLD


The most ambitious attempt to transform a landscape undertaken by an Australian penal
system took place at the afforestation camp at Tuncurry, the first of the Australian prison
camps and the model for many that followed. It is here that the connections between
penal history and environmental history are clearest, and most compelling.61


The land around Tuncurry was—and is—a land of beaches, rivers and lakes. The name
appears to be a transliteration of the Aboriginal word ‘Tukaree’, meaning ‘silver fish,
plenty fish’.62 On the coast there was little for local people to do but fish since the sandy
soils were unstable and infertile. On the advice of the Forestry Commission, William
Macfarlane, the NSW Comptroller General of Prisons stated: ‘The site, while suitable for
the purpose of afforestation, is really waste land, and consists mostly of sand dunes
useless for other purposes’. He also described the site’s original vegetation—mostly
blackbutt and bloodwood eucalypts, smooth barked angophora and dense scrub—as
‘stunted’ and ‘valueless’.63


The camp was an experiment in forestry as well as penology. The poor soil supported a
scrubby native forest, and the location presented foresters with an opportunity to grapple
with a number of the great challenges presented by Australian landscapes: shifting, poor
quality soils; alarming and unpredictable fire regimes; and low-grade timber. Results
achieved with fast growing conifers in other countries, particularly France, gave

Australian foresters reason to hope that these problems could be overcome. In the place
of unruly and unproductive indigenous ecosystems, foresters imagined ordered ranks of
fast growing exotic softwoods, easily workable and free from flame. They and their
colleagues in the prisons departments hoped that the making of this forest would also be
the making of previously unruly and unproductive men. Those who had fallen or slipped
would be made upright, like the trees they sowed and tended.

French foresters had turned a barren sandy waste of a million hectares, at Landes on the
southwest coast, into an enormous, productive pine forest in a little over seventy years,
beginning in the late eighteenth century. This coast had been, according to one Australian
report, ‘composed of bare wild, shifting sandhills, which were at the mercy of every
Atlantic storm’.65 According to another Australian report:


        The Landes consisted of a vast sand waste, supporting only scanty vegetation …
        In the winter … the country was a series of lakes and marshes, while in the
        summer the hot sun … left the place practically a desert … In this country the

        social conditions were pitiable … A scanty livelihood was made [by the
        inhabitants] raising sheep on the sand plains.66


The shepherds in those years were often forced ‘to follow their flocks, mounted on high
stilts’ to avoid becoming bogged (see Figure 35).67


The new forests protected the dunes from ‘the hungry sea’ and made Landes one of the
most heavily timbered and wealthiest departments in France, whereas it had been among
the poorest. At the same time, the population of the area quadrupled, and the nomadic
shepherds were replaced by ‘picturesque hamlets and villages’ with ‘huts, nestling amid
the pines’. The new landscape inspired romantic visions: ‘To watch from the dunes the
setting sun slowly vanish beneath the waste of waters, transforming beach, sea, and forest
into glory of crimson and gold, is a sight not easily forgotten’.68

The tree responsible for this extraordinary, almost biblical, transformation from a squalid
pastoral existence to a flourishing forest economy was the maritime pine, Pinus pinaster.
Through its success in France it acquired the soubriquet ‘the tree of gold’.70 The French
example was an instructive one for Australian foresters. As The Australian Forestry
Journal put it in 1920:


         there are many places, both on the coast and in the interior of the
         Commonwealth, where sand-drifts have caused much damage, and are certain to
         continue to do so, unless intelligent measures are initiated with the view of
         stopping the onward and disastrous advances. France furnishes some remarkable
         object lessons in regard to what may be done by skill and enterprise to recover
         lost land and to prevent the onward march of drifting sands.71


Large tracts of coastal land were ‘either already covered by drift sands or … in danger of
encroachment’. It was a matter of public interest that these areas ‘be reclaimed or made
safe by planting with suitable trees’. In the same year a Western Australian forester
warned that a rising population ‘and the pushing forward of agriculture round the coastal
belt’ meant that it would become ‘necessary to take these sand-drifts in hand, fix them
and reforest them with pines’. There was, he insisted, ‘no reason why shifting sands
should be permitted to spread or encroach on arable or other valuable land. The forester’s
science provides a remedy’.72


Afforestation on sandy country could then either save the sand from the ‘hungry sea’ or
the land from the ‘hungry sand’. The dunes at Tuncurry had previously been held in place
by native vegetation and no significant problem was posed by erosion. Nevertheless,
foresters around the country followed the Tuncurry experiment with interest; if
marketable pines could be grown in the sand dunes of the North Coast, there was hope
that the shifting sands in other parts of the country could be halted at reasonable cost. The
two species of pine selected for the experiment were Pinus pinaster and P. radiata, or P.
insignis as it was then known. The latter, a native of California, had acquired the

cedar, Toona ciliata.

nickname ‘the remarkable pine’, on account of its prodigiously rapid growth in New
Zealand and Australia.73


The dunes could only be stabilised, however, if fire was excluded from the forest. In these
early days of organised forestry in Australia, foresters regarded wildfire as anathema and
dreamt of the day they might tame the flames. Many wrote and spoke of fire in the
language of militarism. It was ‘war’ and fire was the ‘enemy’. Following the logic of war,
influential foresters such as David Hutchins believed that fire was a threat only to the
poorly organised forest; in such a forest the flammable undergrowth was the source of the
problem. When a forest, became, in Hutchins’ words, ‘fully stocked’, the close growth of
the trees would block out the light and kill the undergrowth, leaving only a rich, moist,
almost fire-proof humus on the forest floor. At Tuncurry, foresters sought to create a fully
stocked forest from scratch, and prisoners spent thousands of man-hours organising it,
building and maintaining firebreaks, clearing the undergrowth while they waited for the
canopy to close, and taking turns during the summer months watching for tell-tale plumes
of smoke rising above the plantation.74

The early indications were promising, and the foresters were as pleased with the progress
at Tuncurry as the penologists. The trees grew well in the sand; fires, though not entirely
banished, were few in number and limited in their effect, thanks to the firebreaks. In
1917, J. Hetherington, one of the penal officers at the camp, reported that ‘the pines are
looking healthy, and are growing fast, particularly the first year’s planting, thousands of
which are eight and nine feet high’.76 The following year Herbert Lyne, the district
forester, declared ‘the pines look splendid’.77 Richard Dalrymple Hay, the Chief
Commissioner of Forests, was delighted with the project. After years of grappling with
the problem of scarce and expensive labour, he found the prisoners at Tuncurry did ‘work
which compares favourably with that done by free labour elsewhere, and are admirably
handled’. W. J. Code, the Forest Commissioner of Victoria, had been sceptical when he
first heard of the plan, but said, after visiting the camp in 1920: ‘any doubt which I had
has since been removed by the vigorous growth of the trees which I saw’.78 It was, one
observer declared, an excellent means of ‘killing of two birds with one stone—the birds
being unproductive lands & criminal proclivities’.79

remark echoes Demetz’s call to ‘improve the boy by the earth and the earth by the boy’, and,
occasionally, such dreams could take on grandiose proportions. In 1922, L. G. Irby, the Tasmanian
Conservator of Forests, announced such a vision at the interstate conference of foresters, outlining
a scheme in which neglected and delinquent English children would be sent to ‘forest colleges’ in
Tasmania. The streets of England’s cities would provide the waifs, while Tasmania would make
available the wastelands for them to reclaim. Irby maintained such a scheme would ‘solve the
threefold problem of waste life, waste lands, and immigration’. Irby thought it could, if taken up
around the world ‘pretty nearly solve the problem of the waste of child life’. To great applause, he
concluded his presentation with a rhetorical flourish: ‘Let the waste children of the Empire reclaim
the waste lands of the Empire, and in reclaiming those lands arrive at their own reclamation’.

        outcasts of society.80


In 1925, Andrew Guy, a New Zealand forester visited the Tuncurry plantation, on his
way home from France, where he had inspected the forests at Landes, and come away
deeply impressed. The French forests supplied ‘no fewer than 1000 tons of pit props per
day’ to Great Britain alone, he told Australian foresters.81 Turpentine, paving blocks for
the streets of Paris, and resin all added to the value of the trees. The total value of the
timber and its products ran to millions of pounds, he said. ‘Truly, the maritime pine is
aptly termed in sunny France “the tree of gold”.’ Having inspected the Tuncurry
plantation, Guy believed it to be particularly well suited to the maritime pine, even more
so than P. insignis. The tree of gold ‘was the tree for the sand dunes’, and places like
Tuncurry were only the beginning of a vast, magnificent project, that would ‘literally
cause sandy deserts to be clothed with forests, and so beautiful will they be that children
will walk under the trees as in a wonderland’.82

For some, Tuncurry was a wonderland for other reasons. Just as remarkable
transformations were observed in the men at the camp, the whole place also seemed
miraculously changed. Snakes, though plentiful in the area, were nowhere to be seen at
the camp. Not only was the serpent banished from the garden, the native wildlife lived in
almost biblical amity with the people there. In 1923, James Pringle, a journalist, visited
the camp. He was told, by the prisoners, ‘the story of the wallaby which had been caught
surfing’. One day, this wallaby, nicknamed Nibs by the men, was seen ‘surfing with his
face to the rollers. Hearing shouts, he looked round and tried to escape by swimming, but
was caught’. Pringle was disinclined to believe the tale, but when he went to the beach he
saw for himself ‘a large wallaby, who, held by the tail, hopped along in front’ of a group
of laughing prisoners returning from a swim. He then accepted the story ‘without
reservation’. The camp’s domestic animals also seemed somehow elevated to Pringle. On
the day of the visit, Mick, the ‘old camp gee-gee’ was required to put ‘a solid sixteen
hours’ pulling the cart through the sand, from the camp to the beach and back. It was
‘hard collar-work’, according to the OIC, but Mick ‘never flinched’; he ‘appeared to
know that something was expected of him’, which, according to Pringle was ‘the spirit
animating the afforestation camp at Tuncurry’.84




Minting the trees


Foresters and prison officials spent years happily calculating just how much gold their
trees would generate. In 1926, the Daily Telegraph reported that a net return of about
£150 an acre was anticipated. ‘Experts regard this estimate as conservative and it is
suggested that much of the area should be worth up to £500 an acre’.85 During the early
1930s, however, signs suddenly surfaced that the experiment was failing. The growth of
the trees slowed and they became discoloured and disfigured, particularly the most recent
planting. A great number were damaged by rabbit and virus attacks. Kim Kessell, the
leading Western Australian forester of the day, investigated the plantation during his
survey of forestry in NSW in 1933. Although he was impressed by the penological
dimensions of the scheme, he found the trees in poor shape. The encouraging growth seen
in many of the early plantings was due, he said, to the original stands of eucalypt on the
site. These had been felled and burned, fertilising the soil, but the nutrients had not been

replenished. The original vegetation, derided as stunted and useless at first, was the only
reason the new vegetation had thrived at all.86


A second survey was conducted by B. Byles, a NSW forester, in 1937. He found that the
plantation was in an even more dismal state than Kessell had suggested. The sand lacked
a number of important nutrients, particularly zinc. The plantation was, ‘a 99 per cent
failure and is one of the three poorest plantations in the state’, Byles reported. Many of
the P. radiata stands were nothing more than ‘scattered feathery spindles waving over a
mass of scrub’. The P. pinaster, the ‘tree of gold’, was also ‘diseased and malformed …
The climate is totally unsuited to this species,’ said Byles.87 He urged quick action:


        In the past, plantations which were obviously failures have been maintained and
        extended in order to avoid the decision to cut the losses incurred and in the hope
        that something would be made of them. A clear cut decision is now essential and
        it is recommended that the Prison Camp be removed.88


Following Byles’ report, Lewis Martin, the Justice Minister, visited the camp. He found it
‘to be as it had been set out in the expert report … useless and a waste of money’. The
total loss on the camp, he announced, totalled £75,000.89


Word of these developments was not welcomed in Tuncurry township, and nor were
rumours that the government planned to turn the area into a camp for Aboriginal people
from nearby Purfleet and Forster. T. H. Chapman, the secretary of the Tuncurry Progress
Association, wrote to his local member of Parliament to express his organisation’s ire at
this proposal. It would be ‘a retrograde step and against the interests of Tuncurry’.
Aboriginal people were regarded by the Association ‘as a most undesirable crowd of
people’.90 Why, Chapman asked, could they not be shifted ‘miles away where they will
not be a nuisance to white people?’ Furthermore, he warned, ‘it is rumoured that once

these people are sent to Tuncurry Afforestation Camp they will fire this valuable and
magnificent forest of pines and destroy it’.91


Locals disagreed with the foresters’ assessment of the state of Tuncurry’s pine forests. A
number of them were active in the timber industry and were aware that softwood timber
was in short supply in Sydney. There were, they claimed, ‘500,000 marketable trees at
Tuncurry Camp which should be milled … the local mills would only be too glad to cut
the timber, and the shipping is handy’.92


Tuncurry’s trees of gold were, however, never minted. With removal of the prison camp,
the Forestry Commission was obliged to devise an interim fire protection plan. Four
forest guards, a utility truck and various pieces of fire fighting equipment were stationed
at the plantation prior to the departure of the prisoners in February 1938. The men and
equipment were in place by the end of December 1937, but heavy rain just before the
New Year prompted the department to transfer them to other areas at greater risk of
bushfire. Three weeks later, as a state-wide heatwave took hold, a large fire swept
through the plantation burning or charring all 2,662,000 trees.93 No one suggested
Aboriginal people were to blame.




CONCLUSION


The history of the Tuncurry Afforestation Camp makes plain that the birth of the prison
camp movement in Australia was about more than redemptive agrarianism. Criminality
has long been thought to be especially amenable to the balm of the farmed landscape, and
reformers certainly hoped that the cultivated landscape would exert a positive influence
on inmates. But the camp was established at key moment in the history of Australian
forestry, and is part of that story too. The camp could not have existed without the
enthusiastic cooperation of foresters. The plantation was the first exotic softwood
plantation in NSW, one of the first in the country, and part of an experiment based on

of the forest. The camp site itself was relatively untouched by the flames, and was subsequently
leased by a local family, who developed it into a tourist resort, called ‘The Pines’, although one
wonders what the children made of a forest of blackened trees. Tuncurry S.F. No.283, Site Quality

international experience. Foresters saw themselves as partners with penologists in a grand
project; men with ‘wasted lives’ would reclaim ‘wasted land’, and, in the process, reclaim
themselves. Depraved city-dwelling criminals would be transformed into hardy, upright
bushmen, while the unproductive native landscapes would be replaced by useful exotic
softwood forests. The city meanwhile, would be cleansed of both crime and punishment.
Rehabilitated men and reclaimed land went hand in hand.


This shared faith was short lived. After the failure of the pines at Tuncurry, foresters lost
interest in penal forestry. Forestry was developing a more rigorously scientific edge, with
little room for starry-eyed idealism. Lessons about fire management and the soil
conditions required by exotic conifers had been learned. More afforestation camps were
established, but for the most part they too were placed on inferior sites, and the calibre of
the labour was mixed. For foresters grappling with a drastically inadequate supply of
softwood timber, the camps were of little more than passing interest.


Tuncurry’s tale sheds light not only on the history of forestry. The camp was also
established at a time when a new optimism about the future of the Australian landscape
was germinating. From the late 1890s a movement scholars have described as ‘New
Arcadianism’ emerged, born of rising nationalist sentiment, and the retreat of drought and
depression, related to the ongoing pursuit of closer settlement. The New Arcadians,
Melissa Bellanta argues, were very concerned with both the fate of the marginalised
urban classes and with the redemption of Australia’s wastelands.94 They:


        drew a strong correlation between the waste lands and the unemployed, poising
        each at the brink of utopian transformation. They assumed intensive agriculture
        would convert the waste lands to Gardens of Eden … They also assumed that
        contact with the land would allow the unemployed to ‘work out their own
        salvation … Their key images were that of the environmental miracle: of the
        deserts reclaimed as oases, and waste lands bursting with water and fruit …
        [they] drew a profound connection between the just society and the proper use of
        land…95

Bellanta picks up a refrain that echoes in penological discourse. The parallels between the
New Arcadian movement and Tuncurry afforestation camp are clear.96 It is impossible to
adequately account for the development of the camp without this context.97 The hopes for
the camp drew on a narrative that the American environmental historian, Carolyn
Merchant, would call ‘the garden of Eden story’: sinners in a fallen world, both world and
sinners made good, deserts blooming, animals and men living in harmony. In reality, the
golden vision was thwarted by a recalcitrant landscape—the dunes failed to bloom, fire
was not banished, the wonderland was not to be. 98


The history of the prison camps is now little known and little told and of the few who
know it and tell it, most are current or former prison administrators, or their
commissioned authors. According to them, the camps were simply another milestone on
the road to a modern, humane, enlightened prison system. There is a degree of truth to
this; but as the camps at Tuncurry and elsewhere demonstrate, penal reform has been
intricately entangled with other, very different agendas.

                            ‘A nice sounding word’:
     Prison Camps and the Experience of Rehabilitation



        If there was ever a word that has been misused and kicked around, it is
        rehabilitation. It is a nice sounding word, it rolls off the tongue easily and
        is considered ‘in vogue’ to use it in intelligent conversation concerning
        prisons. But just what in the world does it mean?
                          An anonymous prisoner, Queensland, c.19671




For over three decades prison camps were one of the centrepieces of rehabilitative
penology in Australia. Along with developments in parole and probation, prisons
departments held up the camps as proof of their commitment to this supposedly new
ideal.2 Clearly, the camps were not especially punitive compared to the rest of the prison
system.3 It was difficult to argue that they were particularly effective as a deterrent either.
In penological terms, the camps rested squarely on the idea that imprisonment could and
should seek to improve those who experienced it. In striking language, prison officials
insisted that the camps did just that. In 1916, John Drew quoted Les Miserables in
expressing the fundamental idea on which he later based the Pardelup Prison Farm:


        Is there not in every human soul … a primitive spark, a divine element,
        incorruptible in this world, immortal in the next, which can be developed by
        good, kindled, lit up and made resplendently radiant, and which evil can never
        extinguish?4


Others preferred mechanical, but no less ambitious metaphors. At the Hayes Prison Farm,
Alfred Linton, the Controller of Prisons in Tasmania, wrote: ‘here the waste materials of

  James Whitney called them ‘our best contribution to penology’ (see chapter one).

  According to the Melbourne Herald, Kyeema proved that one of the great maxims of modern
penal theory had been realised, that ‘men are … punished by being sent to prison; they are not
punished while in prison’. ‘Where Trees Take the Place of Prison Walls’, The Herald, 10 February
1934.

an imperfect social system are being salvaged and made up into useful assets’.5 Linton’s
political master, A. G. Ogilvie, agreed, describing the work at Hayes as the ‘rehabilitation
of much would otherwise have become human scrap’.6 Linton’s successor, John Scanlon
wrote in similar terms about the farm. ‘The principal, and indeed most important product
of our farm, is rehabilitated men,’ he said.7 Elsewhere, politicians and administrators
regularly described the camps’ inmates as salvaged ‘flotsam and jetsam’.8


What did these rousing words mean, and how did the prisons departments actually go
about this work? Which prisoners were to be rehabilitated, and what was it like for them?
If ‘rehabilitation’ was the primary penological justification for prison camps, we must
take a close look at how this ideal—often invoked but rarely described—was put into
practice. The precise meaning of the word is hard to pin down, but we can examine
elements of the experience of rehabilitation: the ways in which inmates came to be
identified as suitable for the camps, and the aspects of camp life most closely associated
with the discourse of rehabilitation.




SELECTING FOR SALVAGE


In the 1910s and 1920s prison officials publicly asserted that selection for the camps was
based solely on strict penological grounds: those convicted of serious crimes against the
person would be excluded, and selection would be based on the needs and temperament
of the prisoner. William Holman, at the establishment of Tuncurry, said: ‘No one who has

been imprisoned for crimes of violence or for sexual offences will be considered’.9
Macfarlane elaborated: selection was limited to older offenders and based on ‘the period
of sentence served, personal habits, conduct, offence’ and so on. When the Emu Plains
Prison Farm opened shortly afterwards only young first offenders with ‘decent habits,
suitable physical qualifications, and proved industry’ were eligible for selection.10 No
inmate who had been at camp, and been returned to a closed prison, would be eligible
either. In Victoria, similar statements were made when the McLeod Settlement was
established; particular weight was given to ‘psychological considerations’.11


Until the mid-1920s, most of the prisoners transferred to camp had been convicted of
offences relating to property or fraud, such as receiving stolen goods, embezzlement,
larceny, bigamy, false pretences, forging and uttering, and stealing.12 After the First
World War, preference was also given to returned soldiers who had fallen foul of the
law.13 Exactly what it was, penologically, that fitted a prisoner for transfer to any of the
Australian camps was never clearly outlined.

    ‘Soldier Prisoners’, Daily Telegraph, 23 February 1920. It appears not all ex-soldiers
appreciated the special treatment they were afforded as prisoners. In 1943, G. A., an inmate of the
Hayes Prison Farm, and a former recruit told a warder that he did not think much of where he had
landed: ‘this is what you get for fighting for your fucking country’; see: prisoner file G. A., AOT,
Gaols Department, Prisoners Individual Files, 1891-1960, GD 61/1/2, 811/207. The camps do
however open an interesting window on the historical relationship between rehabilitation and
military service. During the First World War, active service was encouraged in those released
from the camps, and those who died in battle were seen to have reached a kind of ultimate
redemption. In 1917, it was reported that many of those discharged from Emu Plains had ‘found
themselves fighting and dying for King and Country on the Western Front’. See: Report of the
Comptroller-General of Prisons, New South Wales for the Year 1917, Government Printer,
Sydney, 1918, p. 9, and also ‘Annual Report of the Indeterminate Sentences Board for the Year
Ended 30th June, 1917’, in Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly, 1918, vol. 2,
Government Printer, Melbourne, p. 5. David Hall, the political architect of Emu Plains liked to tell
a story about a prisoner discharged from the farm who went on to serve with distinction in France.
‘He fell fighting bravely’, Hall said. ‘I have no doubt, he did more for his country, and for
civilisation, that was ever done for him’. (See: ‘A Prison Story. Man Who ‘Had No Chance’, The
Argus, 10 September 1918). By contrast, during the Second World War, administrators actively

                                                185

Despite their early public assurances, it was not long before administrators realised that in
practice, picking prisoners for transfer was a difficult matter, and that the selection
criteria would need to be significantly relaxed. In public, they continued to state that
‘only specially selected prisoners of the highest grade’ would be selected, but inmates
were not so cleanly divided into ‘types’.14 Privately, they admitted that their knowledge
of their charges was far from perfect. In 1937, Joseph Akeroyd recognised the essentially
subjective nature of the decision-making process. The prisoners at French Island were, he
said, ‘not all specially selected prisoners, selected for trustworthiness’, but simply men
‘deemed to have some latent spirit of worthiness which might be developed’.15 In
practice, selection was based on hopeful guesswork and compromise rather than
systematic criteria.


Although the penology behind selection remained hazy, other grounds for transfer can be
clearly discerned. More than anything else, the demands of the work carried out at the
camps forced the departments to alter their selection policies. It was not possible to
maintain farming and forestry operations with a workforce made up exclusively of well-
behaved, able-bodied, short-sentenced, non-violent, first offenders near the end of their
sentences, who had not been convicted of sex crimes.16 There simply were not enough
inmates who fitted the bill, especially from the late 1920s, when the second wave of camp
building began and more camp inmates had to be found. NSW CGP William Hinchy
reported in 1931 that ‘transfer requests from prisoners from the country with experience
of farming are given special consideration’.17 When the Palen Creek State Farm opened
in 1934, Queensland officials originally intended to restrict eligibility in the way NSW
initially had, but they could not make up the first contingent of prisoners without




discouraged discharged prisoners from enlisting, and hoped that the military would reject those
who tried to do so.; (see: J. F. Whitney to A. Lomas, re: prisoner W. K., 22 December 1941,

including one man convicted of manslaughter and another of incest.18 On the transfer
forms for most of the prisoners transferred to Queensland’s state farms, the ‘reason for
transfer’ was given as: ‘to perform useful labour’.19


Selection criteria were incrementally relaxed from the mid-1920s, barring short periods
after controversial escapes when they were briefly tightened.20 In NSW, from 1925, long
sentenced prisoners became eligible for transfer to Tuncurry.21 In 1932, the rule that
barred prisoners who had previously been at camp from being eligible for transfer was
abandoned.22


The range of eligible offenders greatly expanded, and those with multiple convictions
became eligible too. In 1931, the OIC at Bombala Afforestation Camp noted that:


        prisoners with many convictions who have served years in the gaol are in most
        cases the best conducted. These men will do anything rather than be sent back to
        a gaol … in the past twelve months, prisoners convicted of nearly every serious
        crime in the criminal calendar have passed through this camp and only one has
        had to be returned to a gaol.23


By the 1940s, the only offence which barred a prisoner from transfer to a camp was
sodomy.24 In Tasmania, penal bureaucrats found it impossible to maintain a single prison
camp without ‘a fair cross section of prisoners’, including murderers and paedophiles.25

   There was one type of prisoner notably absent from the camp musters in NSW at the time of
Bartlett’s remarks: those convicted under the Vagrancy (Amendment) Act, 1929. This legislation
was aimed at members of organised crime syndicates in Sydney, and prohibited individuals from
‘habitually consorting’ with known criminals. See also minutes of meeting, 16 June 1940,

When Tom Foley, a journalist, visited Palen Creek in 1945, he was struck by the mix of
prisoners there:


         ‘old lags’ and first offenders, professional men who’ve gone astray, and men who
         have lived ‘tough,’ all go to make up the team needed to run one of these farms
         … there are very few men who are beyond hope.26


Although the ‘old lags’ were confirmed criminals, often with serious or multiple
convictions, they accepted their circumstances, sought to make their time in prison as
agreeable as possible, and usually proved docile and productive workers. Moreover,
contrary to popular opinion and orthodox penological theory about the corrupting effects
of seasoned criminals on young offenders, officers found that older inmates generally had
a good influence on the younger prisoners. Male prisoners under twenty-five years of age
were generally the most unruly and defiant inmates, regardless of their conviction or
sentence. At camp, staff learnt that one of the most effective ways to subdue them was to
place them in the company of older, more experienced prisoners. As long as the youths
were kept in the minority, ‘they seem to mingle with the older men whose influence in
most cases hold in check the larrikinism generally found in young prisoners of this type’,
observed the OIC at the Mannus Afforestation Camp in 1936.27


The most dedicated and industrious camp inmates were often those with life sentences, or
‘lifers’ as they were called.28 From the late 1920s, one or two could be found at most
camps. J. F. Whitney, one of the founders of the prison camp movement in Queensland
regarded lifers as ‘model members of the farm community’.29 In 1954, Whitney’s
successor, CGP Rutherford, noted, not without some pride, that he kept murderers,
burglars and alcoholics all in the same camps. The murderers, he added ‘generally occupy
the key positions’ such as cook, or animal handler, ‘and contribute, by their exemplary

   A life sentence did not doom a prisoner to die in prison. From the late 1910s to the early 1970s,
lifers generally served between eleven and thirteen-and-a-half years before they were paroled.
However, they did remain liable to be returned to prison by the authorities at any time thereafter.

conduct and industry to the success of the farm’.30 Sometimes the lifers had done as little
as two years in a walled prison before being transferred.31 Some spent decades at camp.
The Western Australian CGP Alistair MacKillop said: ‘I find that long term prisoners are
the best for the farm in that they are there for long enough to become part of the
institution’.32


Lifers were particularly useful in the early, pioneering stages of the camps. In the second
wave of camp building, they were often among the first prisoners dispatched to the new
sites.33 In fact, the Stone River State Farm, was established explicitly for long-termers
and lifers.34 Over the years, some of Australia’s most notorious twentieth-century
murderers eventually found their way to the camps.35 With the death penalty in decline,
life sentences became the most powerful expression of societal condemnation, yet these
inmates were often fast-tracked to the state’s least punitive prisons.36


Sex offenders proved useful farm workers too. Their presence caused much agitation
amongst local residents, camp officers and other inmates, but nevertheless by the 1930s,

   One of these was the murderer and musician Alister Clark, who poisoned his wife in 1928.
Clark’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and his file marked ‘never to be
released’. In the late 1940s he was transferred to the Mannus Afforestation Camp where he was
reported to be a ‘model prisoner’, before he was released—to public outcry—in November 1952.

   Historically, life sentences have been available to judges as a penalty for a wide range of
offences, including: sacrilege; aiding pirates; exhibiting false signals; bestiality; stealing wills or
children: burning churches, crops or railways; and impersonating an owner of shares. In practice,
though, the sentence has never been imposed for many of these uncommon offences, or for any
offence for which other penalties have been available. Only for offences for which it has been a
mandatory penalty, such as murder or rape, has it been used with any frequency—life sentences
were commonly imposed for rape up to 1955. Frieberg, and Biles, The Meaning of ‘Life’, pp. 6-7.

                                                 189

sex offenders could be found at camps around the country.37 They were often among the
best-behaved inmates, particularly those convicted of incest, or of offences against young
children. They did not start fights (although they were sometimes attacked by other
prisoners), they typically worked well without complaint, and were a low escape risk.
Moreover, very few had to be transferred back to conventional prisons for disciplinary
reasons.38


By the mid-1950s, there was barely a trace of the original selection policy left. ‘We live
very “dangerously” at times,’ Queensland CGP Rutherford said in 1956:


         as we classify the man and not the crime and we get a good type away from the
         closed prisons often in the first month of his sentence when he may have years to
         do … I do not subscribe to manning these Farms according to any formula or
         proportion of sentence to be served.39


While administrators pragmatically relaxed selection criteria, they found to their
frustration that those prisoners who were of most value at camp were often those with the
least intention of changing their ways in the outside world. They worked well, made little
trouble, and then happily carried on with their criminal careers after their release,
confident that if they were re-convicted, they would find themselves back at a camp
before long. When William Rutherford took the reins of Queensland’s prison system, he
inherited this policy from Whitney, with some ambivalence:


         While this ensures that the chances of escape are minimized as these ‘repeaters’
         know when they are well off, it conflicts, in my opinion, with the intention of the
         Government to give every man a chance, but not to make gaol easy for the man
         who has no intention of rehabilitating himself.40


Officials were loath to publicly admit it, but at the camps the demands of order and
discipline regularly came into conflict with those of rehabilitation, and order usually

won.41 In reality, officials classified the worker rather than the criminal; the camps were
for docile labourers, not for criminal flotsam specially identified as salvageable.


Even on pragmatic grounds, selection remained an uncertain and difficult matter. There
were any number of ways in which a prisoner might be a problematic choice. In 1958,
when a number of huts at Stone River became available for new prisoners, CGP William
Kerr considered the candidates available for transfer, and the documents illustrate the
difficulty of his task. A fair number of the best prospects had already been at the farm,
and had either been transferred back to Townsville prison on account of some
misconduct, or been released and reconvicted. Kerr had to choose from a list that
included: one inmate who had been punished for fighting but was a good concreter;
another was known to have an aversion to work; a ‘neurotic type’; ‘an agitator when it
concerns others’; and an arsonist—‘he might be a risk on a Farm’. The list also included
‘a Bodgie type’ believed to be the ringleader of a gang of thieves, a ‘delicate type’, one
‘inclined to wander’, a ‘trouble maker’, one ‘subject to fits and blackouts’, and another
who was ‘the greatest pest I have and is never out of trouble’. One prisoner was a skilled
cane cutter and believed he would get the transfer as of right, based on his skills. Another
wanted to go to the farm but had ‘sore feet and cannot wear boots’. The offences these
inmates had committed included murder, rape, stealing, child molestation, and car theft.42


The exception to this pattern of selection based on caution, pragmatism and
commonsense was South Australia. When the Kyeema Prison Camp opened in 1932, the
policy was to select from only those convicted of relatively minor offences and of proven
industry and conduct whose terms had nearly expired.43 Moreover, regulations were
gazetted preventing any prisoner over the age of 30, or serving a sentence of more than
two years to be transferred to camp.44 These rules drastically limited the pool of
candidates for the camp. Indeed, in response to criticisms made in 1940 that the camp
was running below capacity, CGP S. G. Blackman claimed that all those ‘suitable’ for
Kyeema were there. Car thieves were not eligible and nor were sex offenders. ‘Critics
would soon come down like a ton of bricks on the authorities if sexual perverts were sent

there and escaped’, Blackman said. After the Great Depression, when the total prison
population fell, it was impossible to keep the camp at full capacity.45 During its
operational lifetime, Kyeema was the only prison camp in South Australia, and as a
consequence of its inflexible selection criteria, it remained a backwater in the state’s
penal system until its closure in 1959.




DUBIOUS SELECTIONS: THE CASE OF NEVILLE HARRIS


Outside South Australia, in the absence of consistent selection principles, doubtful
choices were sometimes made. Officials claimed they were classifying the criminal and
not the crime, but at times it looked like they were classifying the offender’s class or
family. This fact is well illustrated by the most sensational scandal in the history of
Tuncurry. It was front page news in March 1930, and it involved an inmate called Neville
Harris.


In November 1926, Harris was convicted, with another man, of raping and assaulting a
woman at Bondi in Sydney. To make matters worse, Harris was suffering from venereal
disease at the time of the offence. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment by Justice
Ferguson, who said ‘it was as terrible a story as I have ever heard’.46 Harris, however,
came from a respected and influential family and, after his sentence, he reportedly
declared he would orchestrate his own transfer to Tuncurry, adding that he would be
‘surfing’ there within a year.47 It took slightly longer than he hoped, but Harris arrived at
Tuncurry from Goulburn Gaol in December 1929, having served less than a third of his
sentence.48


The transfer came to the attention of the Labor opposition in March 1930. Jack Lang, the
leader of the party, alleged that Justice Minister John Lee, and other members of the
government, had intervened personally to have ‘this fiend in human form’ transferred to
Tuncurry. Lang also claimed he had papers in his possession to prove the point. It struck

Lang as odd that William Brauner, the other man involved in the crime, who had received
the same sentence on the same charges, but ‘who had no means’, remained in Bathurst
Gaol while the affluent and connected Harris was confined at Tuncurry. With
considerable support from the press, Lang campaigned to have Harris moved back to
Goulburn. ‘The Minister’s justice’, Lang said in Parliament, ‘is an outrage on justice and
the most glaring case of preferential treatment of prisoners that has ever been brought
under notice’. Lee denied the allegation, and stated that the transfer was the idea of CGP
Hinchy. Sensing class politics in the air, Lee proposed that had Harris been a ‘working
man there would not have been a word said. It is because he is a boy of a good family that
honourable members and scurrilous newspapers have hounded him’.49


Several women’s associations lodged formal complaints, and sent representatives to
protest the matter to the Premier.50 One of their number told the Minister that they
thought the prison camps were supposed to be reserved for prisoners guilty of minor
offences, and certainly not sex offenders. ‘If you put a rotten apple in a case it is not long
before all the fruit is contaminated’, she said.51 Other delegates thought the transfer
smacked of ‘political interference’ and even wondered if money had changed hands. Lee
saw the delegates as the opposition’s handmaidens, and insisted that the transfer had been
made on routine administrative grounds. ‘I don’t know whether you want us to put the
boot into this man until his full ten years have been served’, he said,

inconsistent policy, including that of Eugenie Falleni, the infamous murderer and transvestite who
presented herself as Harry Leo Crawford. In 1920, Crawford was convicted of killing his wife,
Annie Crawford. The court imposed the death penalty, but it was later commuted to life
imprisonment. In 1930, with the Harris case in full swing, Falleni was in her mid-fifties and still in
prison with no prospect of release in sight. Smith’s Weekly thought she was probably ‘an extinct
fire’ and found the contrast with Harris provocative. ‘Falleni is poor and friendless,’ and would
probably die in gaol, the paper alleged, whereas Harris ‘waits to rejoin well-to-do friends’; see:
‘Politician Who Sets Himself up as Court of Revision’.

Harris would stay at Tuncurry, Lee said, ‘so long as he behaves himself, and the moment
he misconducts himself he will go back to gaol’.53 Nevertheless, the means by which
Harris left Tuncurry were just as unclear as those by which he reached the camp. In
October 1930, in the NSW election, Lang lead Labor to victory over the Bavin
Government. Only a month after winning office, the new Cabinet had Harris transferred
back to Goulburn. The labour press reported the move almost as if it were campaign
promise fulfilled, and relished the fact that both Lee and Harold Jacques, the member for
Bondi who had also allegedly intervened on Harris’s behalf, lost their seats.54 The affair
was later remembered as one of the factors leading to the result of the election.55


The case created a public penological debate, raising the question of how the relationship
between the weight of an offence on the one hand, and the threat posed by the offender
over time on the other, should influence the length and condition of an inmate’s
incarceration.56 It also raised the question of how to weigh the number of offences a
prisoner had committed against their severity.57


In a sense, it was the camps themselves that gave rise to these questions. Few answers
were forthcoming, but the affair did show that the process of selection was open to
political influence. There were other ways to get to camp for those who were not
necessarily useful workers. Of course, all bureaucratic processes are open to corruption,
but the penological foundation of the camps—treating the criminal rather than the
crime—made this sort of incident more likely to occur: individualisation of treatment
could look a lot like nepotism.58 Given how vague the grounds for transfer were, it would
have been difficult to prove for certain whether or not there was anything genuinely
corrupt about the transfer, but this was of little importance. The criminal justice system
depends on public confidence, so the appearance of corruption had the same effect as
corruption itself.

For a few years after the scandal died down, NSW officials were very cautious with the
transfer of prisoners convicted of serious sex offences to camp—demonstrating again that
the rehabilitative principles selection was supposedly based upon could be discarded
without fuss when the circumstances demanded.59

THE MECHANICS OF REHABILITATION


Officials identified three main elements to the camps’ rehabilitative capacity. One was
redemptive agrarianism, which has been discussed in the previous chapter. Another was
the so-called ‘honour system’, which was in effect a mixture of trust and self-
government; the third was sport and the code of ethics it was to instil. The theories on

which honour systems and sport were based are discussed below, followed by a critical
examination of the workings of each.




Honour systems


There were significant differences between the camps as they operated in the different
states, but all were from time to time described as ‘honour systems’, so it is difficult to
determine precisely what was meant by the label. In some states, like NSW and SA,
prisoners signed written statements that they would not abuse the trust placed in them,
while in Queensland, all that was required was a verbal, or ‘gentleman’s’ agreement
between the prisoner and the CGP. According to the rules and regulations gazetted for H.
M. Prison Farm, Palen Creek:


        It shall be distinctly understood that the system in operation is to be essentially
        one of a reformative nature, and that all prisoners are to be given to understand
        that they are placed on their honour to perform their duties faithfully and to the
        best of their ability, and not to attempt to escape.61


Queensland officials also maintained that only their institutions (unlike many of the
camps in the southern states) in which locks were never turned on a prisoner, even at
night, were genuine honour systems.


Despite their differences, the various systems shared some essential features. Apart from
‘honour’, the keywords were ‘trust’ and ‘freedom’. In all camps, the prisoners’ self-
restraint was relied on more than supervision or security to maintain custody. At some
camps, the prison boundary was marked by nothing more than a line on a map. Prisoners
often worked unsupervised all day, sometimes at considerable distances from the camp. A
few camps, such as the Hayes Prison Farm, were unstaffed at night.


Honour systems consisted of more than simply lowered security. Inmates at camp also
had much more control over their day-to-day affairs than prisoners in conventional

farms was significantly different, and superior, to the prison camps of the southern states. See:

prisons. They were better able to negotiate the type of labour they were to perform, they
could use their leisure hours largely as they saw fit, and they could associate with other
prisoners freely. In 1937, Inspector-General Joseph Akeroyd said the Victorian honour
system required ‘an atmosphere where a man gets some measure of trust and is free,
within reason, to manage his life as he deems wise’.62 Akeroyd also said he could point to
‘many men who have spent long years in closed prisons suddenly reforming, mainly
through the better outlook engendered by serving a sentence in a prison where the
qualities of trustworthiness and self-reliance are fostered’.63 In 1942, the prisoners at
Hayes Prison Farm were said to be ‘submitting to the restraint imposed by their own
sense of honour, and are being given a chance to rebuilt their lives in comparative
freedom’.64


Many prisoners reacted positively to the experience of being trusted. ‘Honour is a very
important adjunct to a man’s own welfare and if he feels trusted he will invariably
respond to that trust’ wrote an inmate of the McLeod Prison Farm in 1961, adding that
‘basic good is never destroyed in the hearts of men’.65


Freedom itself, even semi-freedom, was taken to be rehabilitative, but to have any
meaning, high-minded sentiments had to be given institutional form. From the 1920s,
prison officials offered inmates at camps some control over the conditions of their
confinement through limited self-government schemes in which elected inmates sat on
committees which determined certain internal matters. The scope of each committee’s
authority varied, but everywhere they were reported to be powerfully positive influences
on prisoners. Inmates at Castlemaine and McLeod established committees in 1926, which
according to the ISB quickly bore ‘good fruit’.66 In 1932, A. T. Badger, the
Superintendent at Fremantle Prison, said the members of the ‘Inmate Fair Play

Committee’ at Pardelup Prison Farm had ‘a good influence on their fellow prisoners’.67 In
1936 the Palen Creek State Farm was even referred to as ‘this democratic community’.68
Through their committees, Akeroyd said prisoners at camp could, ‘learn to live in a
manner approximating to civil life’.69 (See below for more detail on the workings of these
committees).


Prisoners, or at least those elected to the committees, were animated by the confidence
they felt had been placed in them. ‘Show the men you trust them and they will go ahead
and do the right thing by and for themselves’, said Kevin J., the president of the inmate
committee at the McLeod Prison Farm in May 1961, as he advocated an extension of the
committee system.70 The innovation did indeed spread to conventional prisons after its
trial at the camps.


These committees were an American invention, but the principle on which they were
based can be traced back to Alexander Maconochie, who said: ‘man is a social being; his
duties are social; and only in society, as I think, can he adequately be trained for it’.71
Internationally, some administrators took this proposition to great lengths, such as
Thomas Mott Osborne in the United States and Alan Paton in South Africa.72 For Paton,
freedom was ‘the supreme rehabilitative instrument’. With it he felt he could create a
‘moral community’ in prison, which would be of greater benefit to inmates than
psychological treatment or the mystical effects of the agrarian landscape.73 This moral
community would:

Sport


The camps were the first prisons in Australia into which organised team-sport was
introduced, and the rehabilitation that they were supposed to provide must be seen in this
context. Moreover, prisons, and particularly the camps, provide a useful lens through
which to trace changing ideas about the moral qualities of sport more generally. In
conventional prisons the scope for such activities was limited because of the constraints
of space and security, but at camp there was room for cricket, football and other sports.


Until the 1890s, physical exercise in closed prisons was monotonous and designed merely
to prevent physical deterioration. Inmates walked around circular yards carrying heavy
knotted ropes for an hour or two a day, or simply walked up and down the narrow spaces
between the cell-blocks. Toward the end of the century, physical exercise became more
elaborate and organised, and administrators began to value it for reasons other than
simply maintaining the health of inmates. When, for instance, Neitenstein introduced a
new form of organised physical drill for young offenders in 1896, he said he hoped that
‘by improving their bodies, a corresponding moral improvement might also take place’.75
This change reflected the rise of muscular Christianity and the so-called ‘cult of
athleticism’ in the second half of the nineteenth century, both of which stressed the
importance of organised physical activity in building ‘manliness’, ‘discipline’, and
‘character’.76

From 1916, football and cricket were played at the McLeod Settlement, and at the
Tuncurry and Emu Plains camps from 1918 (see Figures 39 and 40).79 Visiting teams
from the local districts regularly visited the camps to play against the prisoners. Later,
other sports such as tennis and badminton were also permitted. At most camps,
substantial time was put aside in the weekly schedule for organised sport, usually on the
weekends.


In the years following the Great War, organised physical activity for young men became
increasingly para-military. In 1925, at William McKell’s initiative, military drill was
introduced at Emu Plains. ‘The object of this scheme is not to allow the young prisoners
to pass the time pleasantly’, CGP George Steele said, ‘but is an application of the
principle that rational muscle culture in adolescence has its moral effects’.80 In these
years eugenics drew a supposedly scientific link between physical conditioning, and
moral or mental quality. Rational exercise was seen as particularly important for young
men, whether they were in school, the army, or prison.


By the 1920s, sport was gaining ground as a model for social behaviour, and inmates at
camp were regularly exhorted to ‘play the game’ both on the field and when they returned
to the community.81 Sport had become a model for a sort of rehabilitation, and sporting
language implied a set of agreed, uncontroversial rules which if followed by all, worked
for the benefit of all. In this way, sport became a way to learn the values of ‘citizenship’,
which was a word increasingly used in penological discourse. These new words brought
into focus the stark difference between ‘reformation’ and ‘rehabilitation’. In praising the
Pardelup Prison Farm, John Drew singled out ‘friendly rivalry in games’ as one of the
key ways Pardelup fostered ‘a spirit of good citizenship’.82 Samuel Mauger thought that
the football and cricket matches played between the inmates and the McLeod Settlement
and visiting teams from the mainland gave the inmates a sense they were ‘not absolutely

turned down as social outcasts by the community’.83 In the early 1930s Joseph Akeroyd
declared he wished to establish more prison farms ‘to instil ideals of citizenship and
sportsmanship into youthful prisoners’.84 Whereas the penitentiary embodied a belief that
criminality could be erased by placing a prisoner alone with God and wounded
conscience, the camps reflected a secular faith in social due process—gentlemen’s
agreements and fair play.


From the 1940s to the 1960s, sport became an increasingly central part of life in all
prisons, not just prison camps, and this was reflected in changes in staff recruitment and
prison design. Writing of the requirements for new staff, Akeroyd stressed education was
of ‘minor importance’ and that athletic candidates should be ‘given preference’. Well-
built individuals ‘who excel in games’, he said ‘usually have a good team spirit and are
looked up to by criminals’.85 The camps built after the war were often explicitly designed
to give effect to the moral qualities of sport—it was one of their core functions.
Announcing plans for the Langi Kal Kal training centre in 1949, Alexander Whatmore
said ‘special emphasis will be laid on the development of character training with
appropriate participation in sporting activities and correct use of leisure hours’.86 By this
stage, as Whatmore’s remark suggests, the Australian prison systems had taken it upon
themselves not only to seek to equip inmates to enter the workforce, but also to train them
to spend their time away from work in new ways.


By the 1960s, sport had become one of the most important parts of rehabilitative prison
treatment. It had, the OIC at Laurel Hill prison camp said in 1960, ‘an incalculable effect

operations of Hobart Gaol, ‘physical education is…invaluable for restoring self-respect. Physical
games, also under proper direction should be made use of for the purpose of developing those
qualities which are recognised as entitled to a place in a modern educational programme…Anyone
who has seen prisoners in the exercise yards in a prison where no provision is made for physical
recreation can have no doubt that any sort of activity is preferable to the sinister propensity to
congregate in whispering groups’. ‘Report of the Royal Commissioner on the Hobart Gaol’, in

for good on all Prisoners at this Camp’.87 Indeed, for some officers, the relationship was
axiomatic. ‘Sportsmanship is Citizenship!’, R. S. Vodden, the Governor of the McLeod
Settlement told his charges in 1968.88


Prisoners, too, seemed convinced that sport was more than just a pastime in prisons. In
1962, ‘Joe’ an inmate at the McLeod Prison Farm responded to public criticisms that the
new nine-hole golf course at the prison was an unwarranted luxury. Sport, ‘if played as it
should be’, he said, ‘must have a much better overall effect on the inmates than the old
fashioned ideas of Penal Reforms’.89


An aptitude for sport might even be taken into account by the parole boards. In 1958,
Tasmanian authorities considered a parole application from G. D., a young prisoner
originally from Victoria, who was serving his sentence at the Hayes Prison Farm. In their
deliberations, they gave some weight to the fact that: ‘He is only a young man and was
one of Latrobe’s best footballers’.90 After their release, prisoners highlighted their
achievements in their reports to their parole officers. In 1948, H. C., who had also been
an inmate at the Hayes Prison Farm, cited his success as a footballer to show how well he
was settling into his new district:


        I suppose you read about me in the paper and about my football career they spoke
        very well of me and they reckoned I’ll hold my own with any of the other
        wingmen in Tasmania and I’ll try and live up to it the moment they give me a
        chance.91


R. M., another former inmate of Hayes Prison Farm, telegrammed Controller Mullen
from Sydney in 1938, to tell him: ‘REPRESENTING YOUR INSTITUTION AT
EMPIRE GAMES WON’T LET YOU DOWN’.92

MEASURING SALVAGE


Given the confidence with which officials spoke and wrote of their efforts towards
rehabilitation, it is quite astonishing how little they were able to gauge their efficacy. It is
not surprising that they—and prisoners and observers too—took the relatively humane
conditions at camp as evidence of something inherently rehabilitative. But being treated
decently was not necessarily the same thing as being ‘rehabilitated’.


The only quantitative measure of rehabilitation available to officials was reconviction
rates. Sanford Bates, a leading American penologist once called these rates ‘the acid test
of all systems of prison administration’.93 For years, Australian officials spoke as if lower
reconviction rates at prison camps proved that the camps provided a better way of
reforming prisoners than other techniques, and that crime as a whole was reduced by the
camps. But such figures were blunt, arbitrary and occasionally misleading (and they
remain so, despite the increasing sophistication of the statistical analyses).


There were three central problems with recidivism rates. First, they lumped together all
sorts of acts and individuals. Offenders convicted again after their first sentence were
equally chalked up as failures for a prison system, despite the clear difference between,
say, a thief who later committed assault and a rapist later convicted of drunk driving.
Second, the rates were usually calculated using the records of ex-prisoners for two years
following their release. This was done to make the calculations manageable, but it also
artificially inflated the success rates. Was there really a significant difference between an
ex-prisoner who re-offended eighteen months after his or her release, and another who
did not come before the courts for three years? The great number of criminal acts
committed by ex-prisoners that went unreported or unpunished also limited the usefulness
of reconviction statistics as a measure of a system’s rehabilitative capacity.


The third and greatest problem with reconviction rates as proof of the camps’ efficacy
was that the rate had little integrity, in experimental terms: there was no control group
and the sample was not randomly selected. One could apply a particular sort of treatment
to an individual offender, or send him or her to a certain institution, but whether or not he
or she returned to prison, there was no way to compare that outcome with what might

Officials almost never discussed these issues publicly, but in 1958, Norval Morris, a
leading criminologist, summed up the predicament. ‘I do not think anyone in Australia
knows the normal results of what we are doing in prisons’. Reconviction rates had some
limited use, but ‘I know of no figures that indicate that any particular type of treatment
for any particular type of prisoner works better than another type’. He suspected that
those institutions which returned better than average reconviction rates were processing
prisoners that were less likely to re-offend anyway. ‘The facts that we have in this whole
area are exiguous … our statistics slight’. Morris added that there had been no real
attempt, either in Australia or elsewhere ‘to find out the basic facts on which one might
be able to form judgement as to the relative values of different types of penal methods.
We are guided largely by our good intentions’.94 As late as 1988, John Morony thought
that prison authorities still knew little about the long-term consequences of their actions.95


Although senior administrators read widely in the penological literature, they were slow
to establish research divisions within their own departments, and they simply did not
have the data to determine the effectiveness of what they were doing. Their assertions
about the rehabilitative capacity of the camps were merely informed, hopeful
assumptions. This is not to say that there was not some rehabilitative effect in being
trusted, or in exercising a little control over one’s own affairs, or in playing organised
sport. These may well have been improving influences, but prison authorities placed a
confidence in these techniques that was unsupported by hard evidence.


Privately, administrators knew reconviction rates were a very imperfect measure, but they
did not acknowledge that even if better data had been available, a fundamental
uncertainty in rehabilitative penology would have remained: the meaning of the word
‘rehabilitation’ was never defined. As an objective it was much desired and much
invoked, but there was no agreed meaning to the word, and if a goal is never properly
identified, it becomes impossible to determine whether or not it has been met. Ultimately,
rehabilitation is perhaps better understood as a powerful trope in prison reform discourse
rather than as an effective purpose of imprisonment.

At this point it is useful to ask what other functions the mechanics of rehabilitation served
at camp, because they were indeed integral parts of life there in a number of ways.




Limits of honour


While the honour system sounded a fine thing in annual reports and newspaper articles, it
is doubtful whether its workings ever came close to matching the rhetoric. Prisoners were
human, and naturally tested the limits of their new-found freedom. Without constant
supervision, and with the opportunity to hide objects in places that were never searched,
inmates at camp could behave in ways that were difficult or impossible in closed prisons.


When out of sight of officers, inmates often roamed well beyond the limits of the prison
reserve.96 Prisoners from the Emu Plains Prison Farm were occasionally sighted across
the river in Penrith, even drinking in the pubs.97 At several camps, prisoners constructed
rudimentary stills and made their own alcohol from farm supplies. In 1956, warder A.
Collis, who had served at the Hayes Prison Farm since its inception in 1937, admitted that
‘from time to time empty liquor bottles have been found on the Gaol Farm property’.98
Frederick ‘Chow’ Hayes claimed that he ran a profitable SP bookmaking business during
his time at the Kirkconnell Afforesation Camp. ‘I had everything sewn up’, he said. ‘I
was having a terrific time’. It was a simple matter for him to arrange meetings with
punters: ‘You could walk out into the bush, because there were no iron bars, only
forests’.99 At the Mannus Afforestation Camp in the 1960s, Darcy Dugan was told about
a car hidden in the forest, and encouraged to use it for night-time excursions, as long as
he returned it before day-break. Most of the staff, he was told, were happy to turn a blind
eye.100


The fact that staff could turn a blind eye was important. The camps offered an
environment where minor misdemeanours did not have to be mechanically punished,

because they were not systematically detected.101 In a conventional prison relatively
inconsequential breaches of discipline, if detected, must generally be punished if order is
not to be undermined. Arrangements at camp ensured that small—and sometimes not so
small—breaches of the rules could go unnoticed and unpunished, without undermining
the overall authority of the officers, as long as the incidents did not become public
knowledge. As a result, discrete, but not particularly honourable acts were common at
most camps.


In practice, the self-government schemes rarely if ever lived up to their names. Australian
officials never countenanced the radical forms the system occasionally took overseas,
where prisoners were given substantial control over prison discipline.102 When such a
scheme was suggested by NSW prison reformers in the early 1920s, CGP Urquhart
dismissed it as irredeemably and ‘glibly’ naïve. He thought the scheme’s advocates had
failed to realise that ‘inability to exercise self-control is mainly responsible for people
being sent to gaol’. He predicted that such a system, if implemented, would inevitably
degenerate into ‘mob-law’.103


The committees’ powers were severely limited, usually to the use of leisure time, such as
what films were to be shown or which sport was to be played on the weekend, or to trivial
matters, such as when the kitchen was to serve fish instead of meat. Only rarely did
committee members have any authority over issues relating to labour, and never over
issues of discipline or security. And on all matters, the final say belonged to staff. For
some, the committees were not a means to practice the rudiments of citizenship, but
simply new vehicles to pursue the politics of status and privilege common to all prisons.
Rather than acting in the common good, the members of a number of committees used
their positions to engineer the removal of particular prisoners from camp.104 Most of the

committees didn’t last long, and were abandoned in the face of intractable disputes,
cronyism or simple apathy.105


Whether or not a camp had a committee, the real inmate hierarchies were informal, and
determined by the inmates themselves. These hierarchies could support or undermine
order. In 1944, a senior Tasmanian official reported that, at the Hayes Prison Farm, ‘as
time goes on it is possible to trace the gradual building up of a tradition which governs
the behaviour of the members of the colony’.106 It was generally the older, long-sentenced
inmates who occupied the upper echelons of these organic structures. Within a few weeks
of arriving at the Kirkconnel Afforestation Camp, the infamous gunman Chow Hayes
found himself ‘virtually running’ the place, or so he claimed.107 Likewise, it did not take
long for Darcy Dugan to ‘cultivate a godfather role’, after he was transferred to Mannus
Prison Camp in 1964.108


The more astute officers recognised that the prisoners’ own hierarchies were more
meaningful than the somewhat contrived structures they tried to impose. After his
retirement, the former NSW CGP John Morony remembered how, at camp, ‘the prisoners
developed their own community rules, which they enforced’. He recalled a particular
incident at an unnamed prison camp when ‘one dissident attracted a few malcontents, and
the small group were surreptitiously destroying the morale’. The officers at camp were
well aware of what was going on, but lacked ‘hard evidence’. Morony was informed of
the situation during a visit to the camp, and decided that it was a matter best dealt with by
the prisoners themselves. He referred the matter to a prisoner with a ‘long history of
toughness’, who said ‘he would look after it. He did, the position improved quite
dramatically, and I still do not know who was the instigator’.109 Officials almost never
publicly acknowledged that they used techniques like this. They preferred to say that
camp inmates were free to ‘very largely manage their community life’.110


Self-government schemes—whether organised around a formal inmate committee or an
informal hierarchy—and the other features of the honour system looked good on paper,

and ignited deep enthusiasms in a few prisoners, but it is difficult to believe that they did
much to re-make prisoners into good citizens. Nevertheless, these freedoms and latitudes
did a great deal to reduce the friction of life in prison.111




Sport in the life of the camp


Inside the camps, sport galvanised prisoners, and it was one of the very few parts of the
prison experience that inmates got genuinely excited about. After conversation and
smoking, sport was perhaps the most popular pastime at the camps. And indeed, sport
was not just something to do, but something to talk about as well. According to one
inmate at the McLeod Settlement, the men there ‘although remotely placed from the body
of the community, are not so far removed in relation to their sporting outlook. It is logical
to assume that football will dominate their conversation too’.112 From the early 1920s,
they decorated their quarters with posters of boxers and race horses.113 In the 1930s and
1940s the inmates at a number of camps pooled their meagre earnings from their prison
labour to purchase wireless radio sets for their camps on which to listen to the test
cricket.114


Matches against visiting teams were some of the most important events in the camps’
calendars. Prisoners trained for weeks in advance, and wrote excitedly about upcoming
games in internal newsletters and magazines. When, in October 1931, the Pardelup Prison
Farm Australian Rules football team won its first match against a visiting side, the
reaction was intense. D. R. Jones, the camp’s OIC, told his superiors in Fremantle that
‘the visitors were outclassed’. After the final whistle blew ‘enthusiasm knew no bounds
amongst the inmates’. In an era of paper rationing in the public service, when Jones’
monthly report was usually a single handwritten page, he devoted four typed pages to
describing the game, play-by-play, and effect of the win. ‘In no department of the game
were they beaten’, he crowed, adding: ‘It is with gratification I have to report this, the

farm’s maiden success’. It was, he concluded, ‘a very pleasant, enjoyable and memorable
day’.115


Prisoners’ reactions when they were denied sporting opportunities were also revealing.
They were despondent when outside teams cancelled their visits. ‘The air of expectancy
which surrounds an impending visit must be experienced to be realised, as too the
disappointment when a visit is cancelled, especially at the last moment’, one of McLeod’s
inmates wrote in 1965.116


Despite the enthusiasms of staff and prisoners it is remarkable how little evidence they
had, or sought about the penological effects of sport. It was simply taken for granted,
largely on the basis of anecdote, that participation in sporting activities made prisoners
into better people, and less likely to re-offend after they got out of prison.


Whether or not it had any genuine rehabilitative effect, sport was central to the life of the
camps in several ways and served a number of purposes. It was a very effective tool for
maintaining internal order and discipline. It created identities and competitive allegiances
within the institution, and dissipated prisoners’ energies. Senior administrators described
sport as an ‘amenity’ or as a reward for ‘a proper observance of discipline and a hard
day’s work’, or as a way to ‘foster the competitive spirit’.117 But its value ran deeper, as
officers at camp well understood. Warder E. Fletcher was OIC at Emu Plains in the mid-
1920s, and, he candidly admitted that cricket and football were excellent ways to ‘keep
them out of mischief’.118 Fundamentally, sport was a way of maintaining good order, not
a reward to prisoners for doing so.

    ‘Editorial’, Neptune News, July 1965, p. 3, NLA. In the early 1950s, there was still no provision
for organised sport in most closed prisons, and prisoners yearned for some sort of game to distract
their minds and exercise their bodies. John Carslake was a prisoner at Parramatta Prison during
this time, and one day a group of children playing outside the wall accidentally sent their tennis
ball sailing into one of the yards. Carslake watched on ‘enviously’ as the two inmates who picked
it up ‘tried to have a game with the ball, throwing it surreptitiously to one another’, before it was
confiscated by the patrolling warder. ‘Two Years in Jail: John Carslake, an Unlucky Gambler

Sport could be used to pit prisoners against each other, both as individuals, and as groups.
The OIC at Emu Plains believed in the ‘value of the noble art’ of boxing in ‘teaching the
unruly self-restraint and in inculcating manliness in those that practice it’.119 He handled
disputes between prisoners by giving the antagonists boxing gloves and instructing them
to settle their differences in the ring.120 Sport was one of the few areas of prison life in
which inmates could establish, maintain and contest hierarchies amongst themselves in
ways acceptable to the authorities, with those who excelled at sport often held in high
regard by their fellow prisoners.


Many of the camps, particularly those for younger offenders, were, like boarding schools,
divided into ‘houses’, which competed against each other in sporting contests. In the
1920s and 1930s, the two wings of huts at Emu Plains were unofficially named ‘Potts
Point’ and ‘Woolloomooloo’, after the inner-city Sydney suburbs.121 The two were
regularly pitted against each other on the sporting field, and from 1935, the ‘farm shield’
was awarded to the wing that performed best across the course of a season.122


Most inmates at the camps were dissatisfied young men with limited ways to expend their
energies. Sport was one of few outlets, and they played hard. In 1957, an inmate at the
McLeod Prison Farm wrote a poem about the intensity of the football field:


        At French Island they breed ‘em tough,
        And the football they play so rough
        When on the ground it’s no use mopein’
        This is frustrated humanity, with the safety valves open!123


Another prisoner at French Island similarly attested to the ferocity of the games, telling
how the casualties were removed from the field in the ‘French Island Ambulance’ (a

divided between ‘Toorak’ and ‘Fitzroy’; see ‘Brief History of McLeod’, Neptune News, August

wheelbarrow) with not a few needing to be transported to the mainland to be
hospitalised.124 One of the guards at McLeod who took to the field in 1961 later wrote to
his superiors in Melbourne: ‘I am pleased to report that your scribe has since regained the
use of both hands. Sport naturally brings out the competitive spirit’.125 Sport perhaps also
made it easier for prisoners to deal with their thwarted sex drives. One of McLeod’s
inmates thought the best way to deal with ‘the homosexual’ was not to ‘moralise with
him’, but ‘to see that his energies are channelled into other fields. A full sporting
programme goes a long way in taking a prisoner’s mind off matters sexual’.126


Sport was also related to labour. The capacity of many camps increased in the 1940s and
1950s, and from this time many of the camps—particularly the prison farms and camps
for young offenders—carried more manpower than they could use for purely agricultural
purposes. Skilled labourers were still fast-tracked to the camps, but the camps were
required to carry many other, less productive prisoners too. Up to eighty inmates were
held at farms that could have been worked comfortably by a large family. Time spent on
the sporting field was time in which farm tasks did not have to be found to occupy the
over-inflated workforce. The connection between sport and prison labour has been noted
in relation to American prisons by Blake McKelvey. There, sport was certainly seen as an
agent of rehabilitation, but ‘its welcome was doubly enthusiastic because the lax
industrial activity was failing to occupy the full time and energy of the prisoners’. Sport
was, in other words, an extremely useful way ‘to control men in masses’ in prison.127
When CGP Leslie Nott expanded the sporting program in the NSW prison camps in the
1940s, it was done quite consciously with an eye towards filling the hours of the day not
spent working.128


As well as helping maintain order within the camps, sport, like the honour system, helped
officials project positive images of the prison camp system outwards, to the media, local
residents, politicians and the public. In 1927, a journalist visited Emu Plains and saw
‘thirty vigorous healthy, young men lined up in the morning sunshine … Muscles
rippling on limbs left free by gymnasium singlets’.129 In 1935, another journalist

described the farm’s inmates ‘bronzed and very fit, as one can judge from the fact that
they have beaten every football team within miles’.130 Whether or not sport made for
rehabilitated criminals, it certainly made for good public relations.


Similarly, the visits by outside teams were important in humanising prison camps and
their inmates in the eyes of local residents, and in smoothing interactions between the
camps and their neighbours. Many of the residents in the districts surrounding the camps
were hostile to the camps when they were first established, and officers-in-charge
reported the positive effects that these fixtures had on local relations.131 The sociologist
Erving Goffman, perceptively described the ceremonial importance of intermural sports
in ‘total institutions’ such as asylums and prisons. By competing against the visitors,
inmates take


        roles that palpably fall outside the stereotype of what an inmate is—since team
        sport requires such qualities as intelligence, skill, perseverance, cooperativeness,
        and even honour—and these roles are taken right in the teeth of outsiders and
        staff observers. In addition, the outsider team, and any supporters it manages to
        bring into the grounds, are forced to see that there are natural places on the inside
        where natural things go on. In exchange for being allowed to demonstrate these
        things about themselves, inmates through their intermural team convey some
        things about the institutions … that the staff, in this setting at least, are not
        tyrannical, and that a team of inmates is ready to take on the role of representing
        the whole institution and allowed to do so. By vocal support of the home team,
        both staff and inmates show a mutual and similar involvement in the institutional
        entity.132


At the Tuncurry camp, the nearby surf-beach permitted the communication to outsiders of
one of a most compelling image of ‘rehabilitation’ at work. It was established at a time
when the image of the bushman, the pre-eminent male Australian archetype, was being
supplemented by other roles. The bushman was still a potent cultural figure—and many

of the images of the camps tapped this nerve—but in the inter-war years there was no
more powerful image of acceptable masculinity than the lifesaver.133


From 1924, the Tuncurry camp was a surf-lifesaving training centre. Regular drills were
held in the summer months, and on at least one occasion, prisoners were called on to
assist in rescues of shipwrecked sailors.134 J. F. Whitney, the OIC at Tuncurry, reported
that ‘the prisoners much appreciate being permitted … to have an hour in the surf’ and
that ‘a life-saving team has now been chosen … the line taken out, and the drill
performed in a proper manner once a week’.135 (See Figure 41). The camp thus associated
prisoners with one of the consummate forms of Australian masculinity, a form in which
disciplined men developed physical prowess and performed selfless civic labour.

Surf lifesaving training had no proven effect on recidivism rates, but it provided a very
useful emblem for administrators. The drill camouflaged the fundamental uncertainty
about the meaning of rehabilitation, giving the word some content, if not a definition. In
the end however, it probably did much more to mend the image of the prison than it did
to rehabilitate prisoners.




A HOME IN PRISON


Even if the practice of rehabilitation appears on closer scrutiny to have had demonstrable
effects only on public relations and internal camp management, implicit in the concept of
‘rehabilitation’ was the idea that prisoners were to be prepared for the world outside
prison. However, a small but significant number of prisoners found a much more
meaningful and productive life at the camps than they could ever reasonably expect to
find on the outside, and their experience casts an interesting light on the question of
rehabilitation.


Prison authorities actively encouraged inmates to regard the camps as their homes, and
treat them with the same respect.137 As we have seen, some inmates took the invitation
more literally than it was intended, and deliberately re-offended after their release in the
hope that they would be returned to a camp. Queensland prisoner E. S. was one of these
‘repeaters’. Unofficially the prison carpenter, he ‘was never on the pay-roll’. He had been
in prison twenty times in the course of fifteen years, and since the mid-1930s had spent
the great bulk of his time at Palen Creek. Within a week of being discharged, he would
pass a bad cheque, and wait for the police to catch up with him. It was ‘his little lark …
He loved the place. It was his home. His hut was painted inside and out and no one
occupied that hut even during his absence’.138


Phil Hancox was a conscientious objector imprisoned at Palen Creek State Farm in 1942,
where he met E. S. and took an interest in him. Hancox himself thought that ‘life was
quite pleasant on the farm’. He only served a short sentence but if he had not had family

to return to, he felt he could have quite happily spent a year or two on the farm. And,
though his time was short, there was still ‘a ring of sadness when saying “farewell” to the
fellows’ he had come to know.139


One group of prisoners did not have to re-offend to extend their stays at camp. The camps
were, according to a lifer at Emu Plains, ‘the goal towards which all the “old hands”
strove’.140 Lifers and long sentenced prisoners often became deeply attached to their
camps. For example, in 1962, inmate W. N. became unwell. A murderer serving a life
sentence at the Glen Innes Afforestation Camp in NSW, he had been in imprisoned since
1925, had lived at the camp since 1947, and had ‘never shown the slightest wish to leave
it’. He had no known relatives, and before his arrest had lived a solitary life roaming the
west of the state. His ‘memories of freedom are centred on an Australia that has vanished,
and to go back to those days … is to go back to a dead world’. When he was transferred
to hospital, he repeatedly asked the medical staff: ‘When will they be taking me
home?’141


The following year, a Tasmanian probation officer considered the case of I. N., a refugee
from Europe, and an inmate serving a long sentence at the Hayes Prison Farm. ‘His
health is not good’ the officer noted,


        and he speaks very little English. He has no friends to turn to and is afraid to
        leave the Institution. This is a most pathetic case of an inadequate personality and
        I feel that to turn him out from the security which he has found in the Institution
        would be disastrous.142


Another prisoner, who was serving a long sentence at Palen Creek for attempted murder
in the mid-1960s, told his keepers:


        I would like to remain here if possible. Prison life suits me in many respects as
        the work is comparatively light, the hours short and plenty of leisure and rest and

In conventional penological discourse, prisoners who made or sought a home in the
prison camps would be regarded as ‘prisonised’. From the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the psychological consequences of long confinement. The deleterious effects
of long-term incarceration had long been recognised by prisoners and guards, but it was
not until the American sociologist Donald Clemmer coined the term that the phenomenon
became      the    focus    of    sustained      research.144    According        to   Clemmer,
prisonisation—sometimes referred to more generally as ‘institutionalisation’—occurred
when the prisoner took on ‘in greater or lesser degree the folkways, mores, customs and
general culture of the penitentiary’.145 This was often a debilitating experience. The
symptoms of prisoners who experienced it included: forgetfulness, agitation, disrupted
sleep patterns, ‘the clouding of the consciousness’ and a persistent tendency to speak in
general terms in situations where specific responses were called for. One criminologist
described a variation of the condition as ‘a peculiar hysterical twilight state’.146


In 1957, a prisoner at the McLeod Prison Farm, called for his fellow inmates to ‘think of
the long-timers’ in the closed prisons:


         Their existence passes without events or emotion, almost without hopes, without
         the memories which other men create over the years. Their life is a monotonous
         pattern of same-ness, meal-times, lock-up, muster times; nothing interrupts the
         monotony of the same deeds, or the same thoughts. Perhaps they have served

    Others had recognised the phenomenon before Clemmer gave it a name. Charles Dickens
described something like it, a century before. Dickens, American Notes and Pictures from Italy,
Oxford University Press, London, 1957 (orig. publ. 1842), p. 104. In 1916, after experiencing a
week in prison as prisoner, Thomas Mott Osborne described it thus: ‘I had come to have a curious
feeling, like that which pervades the end of a sea voyage. Your world has become so
circumscribed that you almost forget that your voyage ever had a beginning or that you ever
expected it to end. In the same way even my gray prison suit had come to seem so natural that I
almost felt as if any other clothes would be strange. This may sound exaggerated; but it really only
serves to show how soon one can become used to the most unnatural sort of life. A man can get so
accustomed to a ball and chain that he is unable to walk comfortably without one’. Osborne,

Jersey, 1975 (orig. publ. 1916), pp. 133-34.

           long years; of which nothing remains. Not a memory. Not a misfortune. The last
           days like the first. Nothing.147


Prisons departments and parole boards recognised the conflict between prisonisation and
rehabilitation, and their duty to release prisoners before the effects of prisonisation set in
for good, if possible. The Queensland Parole Board, for instance, noted in 1961:


           If a prisoner is ever to be rehabilitated, it is essential that he be released before he
           becomes too ‘institutionalised’. Otherwise the difficulties of readjustment to the
           outside world after a long period of incarceration, are likely to be too formidable
           to be overcome.148


The perils of prisonisation were (and are) real, but it is a cold word, with pathological
implications. As a concept, it makes it hard to see that, for some prisoners, rehabilitation
was a nonsense. These prisoners were hopelessly ill-suited to life in the free community,
but still yearned for some sort of purposeful existence. A few of these prisoners found
such a life in the camps. Some were happier there than they were at any other point in
their lives. These were people who had lived in poverty, been abused, suffered mental
illness and lived without the support of friends or family. Sadly, these prisons became the
only havens they had ever known. They cared little about rehabilitation, they were simply
looking for a refuge. ‘Desire is the foundation of the rehabilitated man and without it
rehabilitation is just another penal cliché’, wrote an inmate at the McLeod Settlement in
1965.149


When one realistically considers the alternatives open to these men, the proposition that
prison could be a real home is perhaps not as perverse as it seems. In a 1958 issue of their

poem written by author and broadcaster John Thompson, and titled ‘Westernport’, after
the bay in which the island lies:


        Here is my true place,
        My watercoloured country cold and pale,
        My wide transparencies of browns and greys,
        Brushed by rainshowers bending with the gale.


        Sway of an austere sea
        Surrounds my cloudy melancholy isles.
        Southerly skies and tides on them and men
        Press the loneliness of their thousands of miles.


        The plover’s anxious cry
        Wheels with the winds and always drifts away;
        Rabbits are fugitive, black swans are shy;
        People withhold the words they wish to say.


        So strenuous a scene,
        Ground of myself, my ego in a glass,
        Is my heart’s home—a region hard and lean,
        Walls of bleak water, hills of bending grass.150


CONCLUSION


The word ‘rehabilitation’ has been used a great deal and very often in relation to the
prison camps. Beneath the high-minded statements however, lay a practice that was
pragmatic, inconsistent and unsupported by research. The camps were undoubtedly a
successful exercise in the reform of the prison itself. They ran smoothly, were appreciated
by prisoners, and looked good to outsiders. Few areas of prison management have ever
commanded such a consensus, and it was in no one’s interests to contest officials’ claims
about the rehabilitative capacity of the camps. Nevertheless, any special potency they had

as reformatory places remains unproven. For the prisoner from Queensland who asked
‘just what in the world’ rehabilitation meant, there was no simple answer. Moreover,
many of the most important elements that determined the direction of an ex-prisoner’s
future were entirely out of the hands of prison officials, and it is this issue that we turn to
next.

                 ‘An Ex-Convict Has a Piece to Speak’:
    Recidivism, Prison Reform and the Life of Grant Hervey



On Tuesday, 30 April 1918, William Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, visited
the prison forestry camp at Tuncurry he had established nearly five years before.1 The
men were paraded before the Premier, whereupon the Comptroller-General, Samuel
McCauley, asked them if they had anything they wished to say to their guest. Holman and
the other official visitors were surprised when one of the prisoners stepped forward, and
‘in perfect English and beautifully balanced sentences’ thanked the ‘author of the
scheme’ on behalf of the inmates. McCauley assured the assembled inmates that they
were not ‘confirmed criminals’ but rather ‘fellows who had made a mistake’, who would
not, he was sure, return to gaol. The prisoners’ spokesman then expressed the men’s
‘deep obligation’ to Holman for ‘this practical experiment of social reconstruction’.
Holman replied that the prisoners were simply ‘men who had been caught in the meshes
of the criminal law’, adding that in McCauley and himself ‘they had not enemies, but
friends’.2 At the conclusion of this speech the Premier was treated to three cheers by the
assembled prisoners.


This episode, typical of the positive reports during the early years of the camp system,
offers insights into both the lives of the varied characters who found their way into the
camps, and into the practice of using recidivism rates to evaluate penal reform.


Despite Holman and McCauley’s assurances, some of Tuncurry’s prisoners did find their
way back to gaol again. Shortly after Holman’s visit, Tuncurry’s recidivism rate was

familiar with the meshes of the criminal justice system; in 1896, he served two months of a two
year sentence for conspiracy to defraud a creditor, after a the disastrous collapse of a daily socialist
newspaper he helped establish. Bede Nairn, ‘Holman, William Arthur (1871-1934)’, Australian
Dictionary of Biography, vol. 9, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, 1983, p. 341. Tuncurry
was not the only prison camp founded by an ex-prisoner: in the 1890s, John Drew worked as a
journalist, and had once spent two weeks in prison for refusing to name a source. In 1927, as Chief
Secretary, he established the Pardelup Prison Farm. Mary Albertus Bain, ‘Drew, John Michael
(1865-1947)’, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 8, Melbourne University Press,
Melbourne, 1981. pp. 343-44.

reported to be slightly more than eight per cent.3 In 1938, just before the camp closed,
136, or just under twelve per cent, of the 1152 prisoners who had passed through the
camp, had since returned to prison in NSW.4 By any standards, these were impressive
numbers. Tuncurry had the lowest rate of recidivism of any of the NSW camps; by 1938
the average rate for NSW’s five afforestation camps was just under thirty-three per
cent—approximately the overall male recidivism rate for Australian prisons in the
twentieth century.5 On this measure, Tuncurry was probably the most successful camp in
Australia. Indeed it is quite possible that no Australian penal institution has ever recorded
a lower rate of recidivism over such a sustained period, although it must be kept in mind
that Tuncurry’s inmates were some of the most carefully selected in the country.
Nevertheless, while those who returned to prison after a period at Tuncurry were few,
their experiences remain illuminating.


Tuncurry’s ex-inmates experienced a weight of expectation not felt by other prisoners.
The camp’s reputation and statistics made those who committed further crimes after
serving time there seem particularly incorrigible. ‘The man who becomes a criminal after
leaving there’, wrote a former inmate of the camp in 1916, ‘is, in my opinion, a bad man
indeed’.6 According to a journalist who visited the camp in 1922, ‘for the man who fails
after treatment at the camp, there can be no hope’.7


One of Tuncurry’s inveterates was the eloquent spokesman who thanked Holman in April
1918. His name was not divulged in the press coverage of the Premier’s visit, but the
Daily Telegraph could not resist dropping a rather large hint when it described ‘a well-
known literary man, who was the central figure in a big criminal case in Sydney some

time ago’.8 The man in question was George Cochrane, better known as Grant Madison
Hervey, a poet, gifted liar, and regular contributor to The Bulletin.9


In 1918, Hervey was serving four and a half years for false pretences and for forging and
uttering.10 He was released from Tuncurry a few months after Holman’s visit, but in the
years that followed he found himself in the ‘meshes of the criminal law’ many more
times. Indeed, he even found himself back at Tuncurry following another conviction for
forging and uttering.11 Although charges were never laid, he was almost certainly a
bigamist as well.12 Sometimes, even when he avoided the law’s censure, he was subjected
to vigilante justice. He was tarred and feathered on at least one occasion, and run out of a
number of towns.13


For all his problems with the law, Hervey’s story highlights the fact that, for many
prisoners, a successful rehabilitation depended on what happened after a prisoner was
released from prison more than it did on with how they were treated in prison. Free
citizens were not concerned with which prison the ex-inmate had been held, or whether
his or her keepers were abreast of the latest thought in modern penology. For most of the
people the ex-prisoner encountered, the stigma of any kind of imprisonment was enough
to cause deep mistrust.


The suspicious world created a dilemma for the ex-prisoner—whether to embrace the past
and risk being ostracised, or to lie and risk being caught in the deceit. Grant Hervey felt
the disgrace of imprisonment acutely, and grappled unhappily with this dilemma.

Initially, he set his sights on a truly grand rehabilitation, not only for himself, but for the
post-war Australian Federation itself. Thwarted in this scheme, he later embraced his
tainted past, and brandished his prison experience as his credentials to campaign for
improved prison conditions. Subsequent prison sentences extinguished his career as a
reformer, but his continued struggle with the stigma of imprisonment, and his past, can be
clearly seen in his later life and writing.


There are obvious risks of relying too heavily on a single case history. But there are risks
too in not facing the individual prisoner, in treating the prison population as a faceless
bloc. Hervey was a strange and deeply troubled man, but his story casts an unexpected
light on the lives of the people most directly affected by prison reform, and upon the
limits of such reform. Perhaps he was, as he himself once said, ‘a good representative of
the average man in gaol’.




‘WHO IS THIS CHAP, GRANT HERVEY?’14


Hervey was born George Henry Cochrane, on 31 October 1880 at Casterton, Victoria, to
Scotch-Irish parents, Robert and Alice Cochrane.15 As a youth, he worked as a
wheelwright and blacksmith. In the late 1890s he began to write. He submitted a few
pieces to The Bulletin, and came under the notice and favour of the editors and journalists
Jules Archibald and Alfred Stephens. A move to Sydney followed, and he became a
regular contributor to the magazine, ‘in thunderbolt prose and hammering stanzas’.16

   E. J. Brady, ‘Autograph Letters Received’, 1891-1915, ML MSS 914. In his day, Hervey was a
notorious figure: newspapers around the country followed his exploits and misfortunes. But he has
been largely forgotten by history, and the few scholars who have written on him have been
uninterested in his prison experience. Geoffrey Serle thought him little more than a ‘versifier and
swindler’; see ‘Hervey, Grant (Madison) (1880-1933)’, p. 275. David Nichols casts him as a
deranged antagonist in the life of Mildura from 1919 to 1921 in his essay, ‘An Australian Ohio?
Fighting for Mildura’, Journal of Australian Studies, vol. 83, 2004, pp. 25-34. Paul Eggert’s
account is interesting and well-researched, but primarily concerned with Hervey’s literary career.

Furphy, counted him a friend.17 After stints on the railroads and in the Western Australian
goldtowns, he returned to Sydney in 1902 and tried, unsuccessfully, to set up his own
literary journal.18 He also wrote for British and American newspapers and magazines,
sometimes posing as the leader of a non-existent republican movement.19 From the dock
of a court Hervey once said, quite accurately: ‘there is generally something doing where I
am’, while a judge in another courtroom, on another occasion, called him ‘a pastmaster in
scoundrelism’.20


Hervey came to Tuncurry via a dramatic and rather sordid chain of events. He lived an
expansive, hedonistic life in the early years of the century. In 1904, Furphy, who was for
a time a great admirer of Hervey, ruefully observed that Hervey was ‘sending his Black
Horse through the mallee of Dissipation and the glue-pot of Wantonness with some
success’.21 The journalist and politician, Wallace Alexander Nelson thought Hervey
‘turned out poetry by the square yard with mechanical regularity. When he had done a
fair morning's work he used to put his coat on and go and have a drink’.22


The young Hervey’s poetry certainly suggested an immodest life. In ‘Down Hill’,
published in 1902 in The Bulletin alongside a lurid engraving by Norman Lindsay, he
wrote:


         Ah downward, downward, downward!

In Melbourne in 1905 Hervey was found not guilty of attempted murder, after he fired a
pistol at a man who suspected him of carrying on an affair with his wife.25 Six years later,
in his hometown of Casterton, he was convicted of assault. His work for The Bulletin was
by this time well known; the prosecuting lawyer told the court he found it strange that a
man who could write ‘such honeyed words’ was capable of the crime.26


Hervey later wrote a poem called ‘The Night I Spent in Quod’, presumably based on his
experience of arrest and remand. It appeared in Australians Yet, his only published
collection of poetry. Apparent already were themes that would become major
preoccupations for him in later life: a passionate anger over prisons, his own fatalistic
thoughts about the paths that lead men into them, and a confused, bitter sense of
solidarity with other gaolbirds. The poem’s narrator encounters, in a mystic vision, the
ghosts of history’s prisoners, ‘a motley, nameless crew’ of ‘shadow-felons’:


        With sunken eyes and shoulders bent, the pallid legion sat;
        All hopeless and impenitent—the scum of Fortune’s vat.
        They spoke no word, but on their soul the vivid ciphers burned;
        I scanned the blazing, fateful rolls, and knew how much they spurned
        The plastic lies and sophistries which wrap the lives of men—
        The paltry, pale theologies, diluted ten times ten!
        I laughed at Christianity; how cheap the parson’s God
        Among those wrecks appeared to be—the night I spent in Quod…27


In late 1914, after campaigning to extend the railways in South Australia, and a failed tilt
at politics in Tasmania, Hervey was short of money.28 John Norton, the populist publisher
of Truth, was known to be seeking to prove that his wife, Ada Norton, had been
unfaithful, in order to prove her unfit for the custody of their children. Hervey had from
time to time worked for Norton, and he spied an opportunity. He visited Norton in his
offices in December 1914, offering to provide ‘intimate evidence’ of the infidelity. This
was, he claimed, contained in a diary, which he offered to bring to Truth’s offices later
that day, in return for £200. Norton was sceptical, and while Hervey fetched his diary
Norton planted police officers within earshot of the room. Hervey returned in the

afternoon with the diary that ‘recorded’ a number of private encounters with Norton’s
wife. Whether they actually took place is unclear, and Ada Norton certainly denied
everything. The officers entered the room, and when they questioned Hervey about the
matter, he denied the liaisons, at which point Hervey was arrested and charged with false
pretences. He was found guilty in both the initial trial, and the re-trial he later obtained. In
a separate matter, he was also convicted of forging and uttering after he attempted to sue
a newspaper editor who published information suggesting that Hervey was
bankrupt—information which was false and had been supplied anonymously to the editor
by Hervey himself. Hervey maintained his innocence on all counts and claimed Norton
set him up and fixed the jury.29 His sentences, imposed consecutively, amounted to four
and a half years.


After his convictions, Hervey was held at first at the State Penitentiary at Long Bay, and
then, in August 1915, he was transferred to Goulburn Prison. From there he tried to enlist
in the armed services, but was refused by the gaol authorities, a decision that rankled with
him for the rest of his life.30 On 26 July 1917 he was transferred to Tuncurry, at, he
claimed, his own request.31


There is little record of Hervey’s time at Tuncurry, other than his speech to Premier
Holman. By his own account, he relished the physicality of life at the camp, and
appreciated the opportunity to work in the bush.32 Much of Hervey’s poetry—like that of
many of his contemporaries—revealed a reverence towards the Australian bush, and an
ambivalence towards the city.33 In any case, Tuncurry must have made a lasting
impression on Hervey; his experience there became central to his later campaign as a
prison reformer. He was released from the camp on 20 June 1918.34

TAR AND FEATHERS IN AN AUSTRALIAN OHIO


Before he looked to reform the prison system, Hervey had some changes in mind for
himself—and for the nation. Shortly after his release, he married Annie Crowe, née
Jeffreys, a widow with two children.35 But he quickly allayed any suspicions that he
might settle into a quiet life. While in prison Hervey had read a book. The title is not
known, but it concerned the establishment of the state of Ohio by General Rufus Putnam
in 1787, and it stimulated in Hervey ideas about the possibilities of new states in
Australia. He dreamed of an Australian Ohio, with Mildura as its capital, and his brief
cameo-role in the history of Mildura is today his chief source of fame.36


In a series of letters written to the Mildura Cultivator during the influenza epidemic of
1919, Hervey posed as an American publishing magnate under the name G. Madison
Harvey.37 The letters described the settlement of Ohio by Putnam and his band of former
soldiers ‘who were willing to face the wilderness, provided that they could get land’.38
With an impressive array of statistics, he painted a picture of a prosperous and populous
state founded by hardworking soldiers eager to get out from under the thumbs of
politicians in Boston, Washington and New York. As the American cities had been,
Mildura was ‘still ruled by the old colonial-spirited coastal capitals’, he said.39 Pointing to
the Australian ex-soldier’s appetite for land, and to a few superficial geographical
parallels between Ohio and inland Western Victoria, G. Madison Harvey declared
Mildura to be ‘the predestined capital of the Australian Ohio of the future’.40


At first, the grand scheme fell on receptive ears. ‘This is an age … when practically the
entire world is being reconstructed,’ the Cultivator told its readers, encouraging them to
listen to Harvey, who was shortly to visit the town to present his ideas in person.41 At a
gathering at the Mildura Council Chambers on 1 August, 1919, sporting a magnificent

astrakhan coat and a reasonably plausible American accent, he fleshed out his scheme to
some of Mildura’s leading citizens with ‘infectious eloquence’, and offered his services
to implement it, for a substantial—but not extravagant—fee. Among those present was
Clement John De Garis, the famous aviator, and chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits
Association. Many of those present at the meeting were impressed, and invited Harvey to
address a larger gathering.42 Harvey’s proposal was also noticed in the Melbourne press,
and tentatively endorsed by Premier Alexander Peacock.43


On 2 August at Mildura’s Band Rotunda, in front of a crowd of two thousand, Harvey
rose and declared that his life ‘was before his Maker as an open book’, and that he
followed in the footsteps of the Chaffey brothers.44 ‘There is good land near Mildura’, he
said, ‘room for the whole returned army’. The land would bloom, with the benefit of
hydro-engineering, he said, channelling his old friend, the writer and booster, E. J.
Brady.45


Unfortunately for Hervey, his life was open before De Garis: a former resident of
Casterton had recognised the visitor and given him away.46 In the middle of the oration,
De Garis stood and announced he had a few questions. Who was the newcomer, and
would he give an account of his movements for the past seven years? At this Hervey
threw off his coat, dropped the American accent, and admitted ‘in impassioned tones’ that
he had spent much of that time in prison in Australia. It was in gaol that he had conceived
his dream of a ‘Greater Mildura’. He had adopted an American persona because he felt
that Australians would pay more attention to ‘a man from abroad’ than they would to a
local.47 The meeting broke up ‘with several expressions of resentment’ directed at

‘Lemurian’ novels of the 1890s and 1900s. These books, which were heavily influenced by Rider
Haggard and the American populist tradition, feature heroes with names like Harry Holdfast,
emerging from unjust imprisonment in dismal cities to lead utopian land settlement schemes. See

Hervey, who promptly left town.48 In later years, the meeting would be remembered as
‘one of the city’s most hilarious memories’.49


‘When his mask fell’ wrote one local resident, Hervey ‘betrayed his awful moral
unbalance’.50 After his return to Melbourne, he wrote a series of increasingly unhinged
letters to the Cultivator. Comparing himself, in the course of this correspondence, to
Napoloen, Moses, George Goethals and Herbert Kitchener, he declared himself the
predestined ‘Boss’ of Mildura, and defended his right ‘to mercilessly flog and scarify any
half-baked suckling Solomon’ who dared disobey him. ‘I am the sort of man who cannot
be ignored … I am conscious of no limit to what I can do’, he insisted. Elaborating on his
vision for Mildura, he announced that he intended to go to Ohio and bring back ‘the
ablest engineer that I can find in America’ to ‘lock and control’ the Murray River. His
fee, he said, was now £10,000. ‘Quick! Make out your cheques. For I am a true King, and
King by God appointed’.51


Thereafter, Hervey abandoned his duplicity in favour of a form of ruthless honesty. When
R. G. Hudson, of Mildura bemusedly asked what guarantee Hervey might give that he
would return from America, if his fee were paid, Hervey wrote back offering just one
reference. ‘Let Mr Hudson write to the Comptroller-General of prisons … asking for the
prison record of prisoner 76’. His record would show that at the Tuncurry Afforestation
Camp he was ‘released every morning at 5 o’clock, winter and summer alike, and
allowed to go away absolutely unguarded to the sea’ to swim. ‘Ask … whether the said
prisoner ever failed to come back—to return to his duty, having once pledged his
word?’52


Hervey returned to Mildura, in mid 1921, bringing with him not an American engineer,
but Florence Lockwood, a pregnant woman whom he called his wife.53 As editor of the

newly established Mildura and Merbein Sun, he launched himself into a dishonest,
vindictive, and ultimately quite successful campaign to ruin De Garis, in retaliation for
‘his famous prison-record stunt’.54 On 22 October, a posse of De Garis’ sympathisers,
reported to be a hundred strong, decided enough was enough. They rounded Hervey up,
stripped him naked, and tarred and feathered him.55 Hervey pled the case for an
Australian Ohio one last time in the pages of The Sun. Then, after remaining in Mildura
long enough to see several of the De Garis gang successfully prosecuted for assault, he
left the district for good.56




GRANT HERVEY, PRISON REFORMER


Hervey had held a cursory interest in prisons before his early brushes with the law, but it
was not until after he had found himself in the cogs of the criminal justice system that he
became seriously interested in the subject.57 Prison tropes—chains, black marias and iron
bars—are central in several poems in Australians Yet, published in 1913. Two years later,
as the judge in Sydney passed sentence on him for forging and uttering, Hervey, who had
already spent months in custody, said that ‘enough iron had entered his soul … to build
the North Shore bridge’.58 After his conviction, he signed the first poem he submitted to
the Bulletin, ‘Prisoner Number 1, State Penitentiary, Long Bay’, and pleaded with his
readers to ‘remember the Grey-Coats’.59



54
   Hervey engineered De Garis’s ruin by publishing reports, in Melbourne and Mildura, that De
Garis was bankrupt. De Garis’ owed a great deal of money to creditors who had invested in his
land development at Kendenup in Western Australia. The reports of bankruptcy were untrue, but
De Garis’s creditors panicked before the claim could be refuted, and the scheme collapsed. See
Milborn, ‘George Henry Cochrane’, pp. 95-109; De Garis, Victories of Failure, pp. 450-58; and

carried out an attack against the De Garis mob, but no charges were laid in connection with this
matter (see ‘Retaliatory Demonstration’, The Argus, 28 October 1921). One of Hervey’s more
winning traits was the enthusiasm for turning his misfortunes or mistakes to his advantage. He
wrote to the manufacturers of a well-known brand of soap, offering, for a fee, to write a
testimonial that theirs was the only soap capable of removing tar and feathers. Francis, ‘Tar and
Feathers’, p. 27. See also Sheila Kelly’s poem ‘The Retribution of Grant Hervey’, in Milborn,

While at Tuncurry, Hervey agitated for better conditions for himself and his fellow
inmates. The prisoners laboured at felling a forest ‘where the trees run up to ten and
twelve feet in diameter’, or so he claimed, but the food was of ‘the most meagre
description’. He led a prisoners’ strike over the matter in late 1917, which, he said, was
‘carefully kept out of the papers’.60 He claimed he drew Holman’s attention to ‘the
wretched food we had to labour upon’, when the Premier visited in 1918, at which
Comptroller McCauley ‘became violently agitated, and requested me to talk about
something else’.61


After his release in 1919, Hervey became increasingly pre-occupied with reform of the
broader prison system. He wrote an open letter to William Holman and, cataloguing the
horrors of imprisonment, he called on the Premier to remember his own days in
Darlinghurst Gaol. ‘What were your sensations then? … Did you not thrill with
indignation to your heart’s core? Did you not in your soul determine that this convict
system should come to an end?’62 After the debacle at Mildura, he seriously turned his
energies to the issue. From August 1920 until late 1923, Hervey appeared before a major
inquiry into the Victorian penal system, wrote vigorously on the subject for Australian
and American publications and regularly harangued outdoor audiences at the Domain in
Sydney.63 Whereas he had previously gone to great lengths to conceal his prison-tainted
past, he now proclaimed it from the rooftops and publicly used his identity as an ex-
prisoner to emphasise his right to speak. ‘I have been melted, heated, swaged, forged,
banged, bloomed and billeted in the penitential mill’, he wrote in 1923. ‘Listen to me …
An ex-convict has a piece to speak … Will you not be courteous, and hear it now?’64

As a reformer—with strangely unconscious irony—Hervey argued that conventional
prisons had failed to reform inmates and had instead ‘flooded the world with expert
crooks’.65 He told a Victorian prison inquiry that prison was ‘the factory for the
production of criminals’. No one came out rehabilitated, instead ‘they learn in gaol all the
tricks of the criminal’.66 The fact that half a million people went to prison annually in the
United States was, he said, ‘a direct challenge to the assumed soundness of our
civilisation’. Hervey had been in Goulburn prison at the same time as members of the so-
called Sydney Twelve—members of the Industrial Workers of the World who had
publicly opposed conscription during the First World War. Although he was no fellow
traveller, Hervey asked: ‘Is it not a mad business? … the out-of-date prisons of this
world, and not Lenin or Trotsky, are the supreme menace of this epoch’.67


Like other reformers of the period, Hervey used the spectre of Australia’s convict past to
rhetorical effect.68 He claimed he came across ‘an enormous collection of heavy leg-
irons’ once, while working in a disused section of Goulburn prison. He believed them to
be relics of the convict period; their presence in the so-called ‘modern’ prison underlined
for Hervey, the essential continuity between the convict period and twentieth-century
penal practice. ‘Human beings lived and died in those things; wretched creatures clanked
along the roads of Australia within them’. With typical brio, he took it upon himself to
expunge this evil:


        I went down upon my knees and swore a mighty oath to God that, when the
        opportunity came, I would so speak to the living hearts of men that the convict
        regime in Australia, which still obtains in Australia in spirit and in practice,
        would forever cease.69


Hervey reserved some of his best vitriol for Frederic Neitenstein. Contrary to
Neitenstein’s reputation as a moderniser, Hervey thought him ‘entirely representative of
the spirit of the early convict days’. By this stage, Neitenstein had been dead for over a
decade, and Hervey thought it ‘a good job’. Admitting that William Urquhart, the present
Comptroller-General was a sympathetic and principled individual, Hervey asserted that

system that is so utterly out of date’.70


In 1922, the Minister for Justice, T. J. Ley proposed to reopen Parramatta Gaol, which
had been closed since 1919. Hervey decried the ‘Botany Bay intelligence’ behind the
policy. It prompted him to ponder of state’s leaders, ‘are their minds stuck in the convict
epoch—the eighteen-twenties and the eighteen-thirties? Personally, I am inclined to think
that they are’.71 Instead of re-opening an institution ‘which still resounds with the
clanking of invisible fetters upon poor dead men’s heels’, the way of the future was to be
seen on the north coast. At Tuncurry there was ‘a changed tune’.72 Hervey praised the
scheme as ‘the first sensible thing that was ever done in the prison history of New South
Wales’. His fellow prisoners at the camp were:


        burglars, racecourse spielers, pillar box thieves—all the indescribable flotsam
        and jetsam that flows into prison out of the temptation ducts of a great city. And
        yet, with all their faults, they were white. They were true to the State. They gave
        it their labor in the forest.73


Publicly addressing William Holman again, Hervey issued a plea for the former Premier
to re-enter Australian politics as a prison reformer and become ‘a world-force for good’.
The success of Tuncurry entitled its founder to ‘say to the people of Australia, “Close
down your convict prisons”. Men behave like men when they are treated white. This is
the way that true reform should go’.74


In addition to his call for a greatly expanded prison camp system, Hervey also laid out a
detailed agenda of other reforms. Every first offender, bar those convicted of crimes such
as rape or murder, ‘instead of being plunged into the soul-blackening, mind-
contaminating vats of prison’ should be treated ‘as a man with the makings of a worthy
and a useful citizen, and so be given a new chance’.75 For those who committed serious

crimes or were convicted more than once, Hervey argued for better conditions in prison.
He called for improved remuneration and training for guards, better architecture, and
more visits from religious and community groups. The average prisoner, he said,


        becomes discontented and willing to take any risk because he feels that nobody
        cares for him or takes any interest in him … Just so soon as they see that they see
        that there is someone taking an interest in them, then just so soon will the
        improve in different areas.76


He argued for improved prison libraries, and better training for librarians to enable them
to provide prisoners ‘with the class of book that is likely to help them’.77 New prisons
should be built in rural areas, ‘at least twenty to thirty miles from a city … so that when
he gets out, his face is turned to the country, rather than to the city’. With distinct echoes
of his own experience, he also addressed the ex-prisoner’s stigma:


        When a man goes into gaol for the first time, he is terribly humiliated, especially
        if he held a responsible position … it is when the man goes outside and finds the
        world so hostile and there is no hope given to him, he says to himself I may as
        well become a professional crook.78


Just as he had in Mildura, Hervey looked to American models, and he was particularly
influenced by the work of the pioneering humanitarian penologist Thomas Mott Osborne.
Osborne was ‘a millionaire industrialist with a reputation for philanthropy’ and a
taste—like Hervey—for disguise and impersonation.79 From 1896, Osborne served as a
trustee and later chairman of the board of the George Junior Republic in Freeville, New
York.80 The Republic was an institution for delinquent youths. There, Osborne

   ‘Minutes of evidence’, p. 544. No prison library, Hervey said, was complete without a copy of
Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essays: ‘nothing struck me more in the prisons of New South Wales, than
the enormous effect that Emerson’s Essays had on the average man. It may seem strange that the
philosophy of Emerson should have any effect on prisoners, but I have seen men … fight one
another for the possession of the book when they were released’. See also ‘Reformer’, Crime and
Criminals, pp. 12-13. Hervey himself later worked as librarian in Bathurst Prison in the early
1930s. Palmer, Nettie Palmer, pp. 113-14.

   Osborne would often wander the streets at night incognito. He claimed it was ‘only in this way
that he was able to find out what people were really thinking’. Gordon Hawkins, ‘Thomas Mott

experimented with a number of innovations, including the honour system, paid labour
and self-government. In 1913, before taking up an appointment as chairman of a state
prison reform commission, he spent a week in Auburn prison, as an ordinary prisoner. ‘I
have come out’, he later wrote, ‘with a new sense of human brotherhood, a new faith in
God’.81 He later went on to serve as Warden at Sing Sing Prison in New York and
Portsmouth Naval Prison in Maine, where he pursued similar lines of reform to those he
developed at the George Junior Republic.


In the mid 1910s, Osborne published a number of works of radical penology.82 ‘It is
liberty alone that fits men for liberty’, he wrote in one.83 For Osborne, this simple truth
made the traditional prison an absurdity. It endeavoured:


        to make men industrious by driving them to work; to make them virtuous by
        removing temptation; to make them respect the law by forcing them to obey the
        edicts of an autocrat; to make them far-sighted by allowing them no chance to
        exercise foresight; to give them individual initiative by treating them in large
        groups; in short, to prepare them again for society by placing them in conditions
        as unlike real society as they could well be made.84


As a prison administrator, Osborne sought to make prisons more like the society to which
prisoners were returned. Most prisons were, he said ‘monuments of wasted effort, of
misguided service’.85 He helped abolish floggings and the rule of silence, and established
inmate self-government committees and prison camps. Although some of his reforms
were short-lived, he had a significant influence on other penologists and administrators.86

Hervey greatly admired Osborne. ‘That man sounded and reported upon the penitential
depths … he put into effect … actual reforms, not official plasterings and eye-wash
pretences’.87 Hervey became a conduit though which Osborne’s ideas were transmitted to
penological debate in NSW.88 He called for Australian prisons departments to imitate the
reforms made by Osborne at Sing Sing. Although he failed to persuade administrators, he
did raise sufficient public support for Osborne’s precepts that Urquhart was force to
refute them in print. Referring to ‘local critics’ who saw ‘perfection’ in Osborne’s work,
Urquhart relegated Osborne’s schemes to ‘the limbo of unattainable ideas’.89


Forcing the head of the NSW prison system to consider Osborne’s ideas was probably
Hervey’s paramount achievement as a prison reformer.90 Whether or not he might have
gone on to greater things not clear; his career as a reformer was curtailed by a return to
prison in late 1923 for stealing a cheque book and forging and uttering cheques from it.91

achieved great things with the help of disguise and role-play was surely not lost on Hervey too.
88
   In Victoria, the most prominent of Osborne’s advocates was Samuel Mauger, the chairman of
the ISB. Mauger visited the United States in 1919 and came away deeply impressed with
Osborne’s thinking. It is possible that Mauger introduced Hervey to Osborne’s work when Hervey
visited Melbourne in 1920 to appear before a Victorian penal inquiry. See Mauger, Society and
Prisons, and also ‘Minutes of Evidence’.

   This conclusion is based, in part, on an assumption that Hervey was ‘Reformer’, the author of a
number of articles written for the Sunday Telegraph in mid 1923 and later republished as Crime
and Criminals: Study of Defects in Our Prison System, G. W. Hall & Co., Sydney, 1923. Hervey
was the most prominent critic of the NSW prison system in 1923, and his agenda bore a striking
resemblance to Reformer’s: they both argued forcefully on the need to improve prison
libraries—and both cited Emerson in so doing; prison food was a subject close to both their hearts;
both were fierce critics of solitary confinement, prison labour policy and the Prisoners’ Aid
Association; both championed Thomas Mott Osborne’s principles and evoked the convict past as a
rhetorical device; both insisted that people were not to be sent to prison for punishment, but were
punished by being sent to prison, both heavily stressed the importance of regular visits to convicts
by religious and community groups; both praised Tuncurry and were in favour of a large
expansion of the camp system in order to develop what they saw as a vast, unexploited wilderness.
Reformer’s articles were, admittedly, written in a more measured tone than that Hervey usually
adopted, but Hervey adopted different styles when he wrote under pseudonyms, as he often did.
The content of Reformer’s articles suggest they were written by a ex-prisoner with the same mix
of sympathy and scorn for prisoners that Hervey had. By contrast, outspoken critics of the prison
system usually cast prisoners as innocent victims. In addition, it appears that Reformer was also a
prohibitionist, as Hervey was at this time.

‘protest’ against his earlier convictions and to provide for his wife and child. Florence told the
court that her husband’s ‘mind had become affected by the nursing of a grievance against society’
because of his previous convictions and sentences.

                                                238

It is possible that Hervey had greater practical success in changing the prison system from
within, as a prisoner, than he did as a concerned citizen. In August 1925, Justice Minister
William McKell approved a change in regulations under which prisoners serving long or
life sentences became eligible for special transfer to Tuncurry, so that they might improve
their physical health. Up to this point only prisoners near the end of relatively short
sentences had been eligible. The prisoners themselves would decide who would be
transferred, and would be ‘held responsible for a proper selection’. Those chosen would
be given to understand that ‘their failure at the camp will lead to the arrangement being
discontinued’.92 The practice, which appears to be derived from Osborne’s penology, was
approved by George Steele, Urquhart’s successor as CGP. At the time the regulation
came into effect, Hervey had been back at the north coast camp for six months. The OIC
later reported that the prisoners transferred under the scheme were the best workers he
had.93




A GRADUATE OF ‘THE TRUE ACADEMY OF LETTERS’94


Grant Hervey was released from the Tuncurry Afforestation Camp for the second time on
17 October 1925.95 Whether or not he had anything to do with the change in regulations
in August, it seems that he left without the will to continue as a reformer. And for a time
it seems he was content to try and work out his salvation on a personal, domestic stage. In
1922 Lockwood and Hervey’s son, Lincoln, had been born. In late 1925 or early 1926 the
three moved to Brisbane.96 Watching his family grow had a profound effect on Hervey.
He thought he had escaped his past self, that he had been ‘saved from the everlasting
masculine curse of selfishness by the arms of a little child’:


         I suspect that I have been one of the most selfish men alive … I make no bones
         about my own confession. I say, candidly, that I am utterly ashamed of
         myself—of that base self which existed in my name, in childless days. But

   Lincoln’s name reflected his father’s American enthusiasms; in his writings, Grant Hervey often
referred to the ‘spirit of Lincoln’, (e.g. ‘Official Schools of Crime’, p. 2096).

        Motherhood cured me. Motherhood in my own home put that inferior fellow in
        the cemetery. And I want him to stay there, good and hard, for the next three
        million years … Motherhood is a miraculous thing that can swallow up many a
        lazy useless Jonah—and cast him up, re-invigorated, with a soul, a will, and a
        purpose of his own, upon the Beach of Time.97


Hervey lent his support to the campaign to have Mother’s Day recognised in Australia,
adding, ‘I am proud to identify myself with the Motherhood movement’.98 But he soon
turned his pen to less idealistic purposes. Back in Sydney in 1929 he became joint-editor
of a scurrilous weekly newspaper called Beckett’s Budget. In 1930 he was fined for
unseemly language during one of his Domain speeches and, according to rumour, he was
again tarred and feathered in his home town, Casterton, for further disreputable
journalism.99 In April 1931, he found himself facing a term of imprisonment once more,
and there would be no return to Tuncurry this time. In sentencing Hervey to two years in
prison for forging a telegram, the judge specified that Hervey be held in Bathurst Gaol.100


By the time he got to Bathurst, Hervey’s attitude towards imprisonment had changed
again. He still acknowledged his status as an ex-prisoner, but bitterly now, and without
zeal. The reformist fire had gone out of him—all that was left was smouldering
resentment.101 The prison and its stigma were no longer political obstacles to be
overcome; they were instead an evil he had deliberately faced, and overcome:


        I deflated prison itself. I went back there … to laugh at it and treat stone walls
        and iron bars with derision for I am a living sword of realistic will power which
        passes through prisons and kings’ palaces with the swift thrust of eudamonic
        contempt.102


As he gave up on redeeming himself by redeeming the prison, he began to see his
degradation as an inmate as an essential part of his education as a writer. He compared

himself to other authors who had been prisoners, including Oscar Wilde, Henry Lawson,
O. Henry, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.103 His old friend E. J. Brady remembered Hervey
telling him, late in life, that ‘no man could expect to become a great writer until he had
undergone a term of imprisonment. He looked upon gaol as the true Academy of
letters’.104


While in Bathurst Gaol, Hervey worked as prison librarian, and wrote his one published
novel, An Eden of the Good.105 In the prologue, he describes American academics of his
acquaintance who spent sabbatical years in China or Peru. ‘I have gone one better, myself
… I habitually shock the right thinking philanthropoid apes of Australia by going back to
gaol with a quiet smile and a confident heart’ in order to examine ‘these human snakes
and legless reptiles of Australia, and in order to see for myself, at close range, in short,
how the spiritual, moral and intellectual resurrection of Australia proceeds’.106


Hervey funnelled his remaining fantasies of redemption into his book.107 Set in the 1830s,
it was a novel of thin disguises, concerned largely with the fate of George Hervey, a
lowly convict transported to Van Diemen’s Land. It also relates the rise of the freeborn
brothers Cochrane of Bathurst: Randolph, a poet with an impressive physique, and
Walter, who married Mildura Saltram, a daughter of the squattocracy, and then founded a
town on the River Murray named after his wife. Several historical personages figure in
the narrative too, including William Wentworth, John Dunmore Lang, and Charles
Darwin. The penal system that George Hervey encounters is a grotesque caricature, full
of ‘groaning, quivering and screaming creatures upon the triangles’.108 But George
survives, and rises to become the enlightened Comptroller General of all the prisons in
Australia. ‘They did their damnedest with their iron-gangs, but they have not made a
villain out of me yet … I am the man that Australia needs—a man who has been through
the unspeakable depths of this convict system—and I intend to be heard’.

    The book was published in 1934, a year after Hervey’s death. Hervey claimed to have
completed a sequel, but it was not published and the manuscript appears to have been lost. He also
wrote an unfinished serialised novel A Don Quixote of the Saltbush. A story of redeemed convicts,
bountiful irrigated landscapes and Australian interracial harmony, it ran in the Mildura and
Merbein Sun, from August to October, 1921.

Nettie Palmer, the famous writer and critic, reviewed the book in 1935. It was, she said,
‘a fairy-tale that at some parts holds together, at others collapses: the work of an unusual
man’, words that apply to Hervey’s life, as much as his novel.109 He never read the
review. Shortly after his final release from prison, in 1933, he died of diabetes.110 Brady
remembered him as:


        a genius with a kink … Although he spent some time in the penitentiary one
        never could regard him as a true criminal … Certainly a self-made victim of
        social circumstance … He was not strong enough to stand up to economic
        pressure. He was in a measure the victim of enemies more ruthless & less gifted
        than himself. Others have had similar experiences of life & surmounted their
        difficulties. Hervey failed to do so … his mind had slipped a cog. But for the
        grace of God—there might have gone any of us!111




CONCLUSION


Modern penology offers attractive terms. ‘Rehabilitation’ sounds appealing, and coherent
as a process, and it is tempting to read recidivism statistics as measures of its success or
failure. Grant Hervey’s unfortunate life reminds us that beneath the smooth rows of
official statistics and pleasant-sounding words lie messy, complicated lives. Was he
‘rehabilitated’ by his time in Tuncurry? In one sense, he quite clearly was not. In the
official records, he figures as one of Tuncurry’s few failures, and he himself admitted he
‘went to gaol a good deal’.112 He sought redemption in several quarters, but it is quite
probable that no prison treatment in the world could have prevented his recidivism. He
acknowledged he was ‘no angel’, and he appears to have suffered from what would now
be described as mental illness.113 But others are implicated in his recidivism. When he
was released no one cared that he had been held at the Tuncurry Afforestation Camp, and
that his incarceration there had been based on the latest penological principles, nor that he

that criminals ‘should be considered mentally deranged’. ‘Floggings for Violence’, The Argus, 11

had been, by all accounts, a model prisoner. Prison authorities tried to make prison camps
seem as little like prisons as possible, but to free citizens, prisons without walls were still
prisons, and Hervey felt acutely stigmatised regardless.


So, there was a certain irony in Hervey’s remarks to Premier Holman in April 1918, and
in his pains to reform the prison system with Tuncurry as his model. Like the
administrators and the general public, he wanted to believe that the solution to crime
could be found in the right prison treatment, but while the camp could make him into a
prison reformer, it could not make him a reformed person. In this way he was an excellent
exemplar of the camp—proof that the reformed prison and the reforming prison were
very different things.

                      ‘My foolish, boyish escapade’:
                        Escapes from Prison Camps



         The taxpayers do not provide the money to allow their crooks and gunmen
                           to come back upon them with impunity.
                                      Brisbane Sun (1924)1


             Custodial routines are simply the residue of a punitive orientation
                         toward the criminal, the contaminated man.
                                     Gresham Sykes (1958)2




In 1935, a sympathetic observer of the NSW prison system, writing as ‘Braemar’, thought
there were many reasons to admire the Emu Plains Prison Farm, ‘but the highest
compliment of all is this: in four years only one attempt to escape has been made from
this prison without walls’.3 In saying so, ‘Braemar’ identified a penological item of faith.
Among all the conflicting theories of incarceration—punishment, deterrence,
rehabilitation, expiation and so on—one of the few points of agreement has been that
penal institutions exist to maintain custody over those sentenced to imprisonment by the
courts. Whatever else prisons have or have not done, a consensus has existed that custody
must be secure. Accordingly, rates of escape from prison have long been ‘a basic
performance measure for all correctional departments’.4

escape. McConville, A history of English prison administration, Volume I, 1750-1877, Routledge

The low escape rates initially recorded at Tuncurry and Emu Plains helped drive the
spread of prison camps around Australia.5 Nevertheless, the lack of security measures at
the camps provoked public anxiety about the likelihood of prisoners escaping. After all, it
was so simple—as one observer noted of Palen Creek State Farm in 1945, with the cattle
grid at the front gate, more was done at the farm to stop stock wandering than to prevent
inmates escaping (see Figure 45).6 These anxieties reflected stereotypes about prisoners
in general and escapees in particular as desperate, dangerous villains. The history of
escapes from the Australian prison camps, read in light of recent criminological research
on escapes, suggests that these stereotypes were ill-founded. Yet escape rates continued
to influence penal policy, with unfortunate, and arguably unnecessary consequences.

  When administrators from other states visited NSW, they were struck by the remarkably low
incidence of escape at Tuncurry and Emu Plains. Upon their return they used these figures to
persuade politicians to establish similar institutions. ‘Prison Reform. Gratifying Results. New
South Wales System’, Courier Mail, 26 September 1933. Indeed, low escape rates from the New
Zealand camps helped persuade NSW authorities to experiment with prison camps in the first
place. ‘Prison Work. Afforestation Camp’, SMH, 1 November 1913.

ESCAPES AND THE MASS MEDIA


The great majority of inmates who chose not to escape were effectively invisible, but for
them, the ever-present possibility that they could escape was an important test of trust,
and a key element of the penology behind the camps. The British Prison Commissioners
thought that the great value of the open institution lay in the choice it presented to the
prisoner: to escape or to remain. ‘Here is an acid test which, if successfully borne, goes a
long way towards instilling a sense of responsibility’.7


Newspapers have been more interested in the few who failed the test. In 1958, Alexander
Whatmore, the Director of Prisons in Victoria, said that prison administrators went to bed
with the prayer ‘God save me from the front page headlines’.8 Nothing made for better
copy than reports of convicted criminals on the loose, no matter where it happened. In
1924, after a prisoner with a record of violence escaped from St Helena, the Brisbane Sun
railed against the Queensland prisons service: ‘This slipshod imitation of a gaol has now
been in existence too long, and it is time that it was tightened up … If this thing is to be
called a gaol, then let it be something approaching one at least’.9 This was one of a
number of sensational escapes in the mid-1920s which fuelled sentiment against the St
Helena institution, contributing to its closure in 1933.10


‘DANGEROUS LUNATIC ESCAPES’, the Sydney Morning Herald shrieked when a
prisoner escaped from a prison farm in Western Australia in 1940.11 Officials were
concerned to the point of secrecy about this sort of media coverage. In June 1953, the
Victorian press caught wind of a mass breakout from the McLeod Settlement some

even had a prisoner or two who have come to us to say he doesn’t think Kirkconnell is the right
place for him – the absence of bars and gates is too great a temptation’, the Chief Warder told a
reporter in 1963. Bob Johnson, ‘A poisoner cooked my lunch’, Sun Herald, 3 February 1963.

months earlier. Seventy-eight prisoners were said to have absconded. No mention of the
matter had been made at the time to the media. In response, Chief Secretary William
Galvin stated that only forty-nine had escaped, that none of the escapees had made it off
the island, and that all had been quickly recaptured, so that under the circumstances, he
saw no reason why the prisons department should have notified the press.12




ESCAPES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES


Those who lived near prison camps were deeply unsettled when a prisoner got away.
After the first escape from Hayes Prison Farm, in July 1937, M. B. Terry, whose property
adjoined the prison reserve, told acting Premier, E. Dwyer Gray, ‘we are all on edge
round this district & wonder what to expect next’.13 One morning in December 1938,
after hearing a shot in the night and the gaol bell rung, Terry woke to learn of another
escape from Hayes. He wrote again to the Premier: ‘It is a very unpleasant state of affairs
… my wife will not stay alone & is very nervy. If the prisoners cannot be controlled, in
fairness to the district, it would only be proper to close the thing up’.14


Across the country, unease simmered in the communities adjacent to the camps. In the
1940s, on the basis of several scandalous breakouts, Pardelup Prison Farm was described
by Arthur Watts, the Member for Katanning, as ‘a menace to the surrounding territory’.15
Tensions ran particularly high between the Victorian penal authorities and the settlers on
French Island, near the McLeod Settlement. Escapees sometimes stole settler’s boats,
motor vehicles or horses as they made their escape.16 A few entered homes to steal food
or clothes, or to use a telephone.17 In 1927, B. A. De La Haye of French Island
complained that since the camp was established in 1916, property values had dropped to
the point that it had become impossible to sell land on the island, and outsiders could not

be induced to settle.18 ‘French Island used to be a lovely place once,’ an unhappy resident
said in 1936, ‘but since the penal farm came it has gone back’.19 Some in the community
laid in weapons and others formed armed vigilante groups to round up escaped
prisoners.20 By 1936, many were afraid to leave their homes and families unprotected.21
They complained of:


         the futility of endeavouring to maintain discipline over fifty or sixty criminals
         without having any walls of restraint … It is absurd trying to reform prisoners by
         allowing them to roam at liberty.22


Some on the island adapted to living next to the camp, but escapes always remained a
source of unease.23 In November 1955, the farmers were reported to ‘hate their proximity’
to the camp, and sleep ‘with shotguns at their beside, their womenfolk a prey to fears’.24
A poem written by long-term French Island resident, “Grandad” Chandler, caught the
concern escapees caused residents with less melodrama but equal effect:


         Three rings on the phone, is the cause for alarm,
         A couple of crims broke loose from “The Farm.”
         Now these coves may be dangerous, they’re not in there for fun,
         So ya hide all yer ammo and dismantle yer gun!

   ‘French Island. Penal Farm-Settlement?’. In other communities, locals even seemed to relish
being involved in the hunt for escapees. In 1961, for instance, several members of the Taplan
football team, still in their playing uniforms, helped police and blacktrackers catch a number of
prisoners escaped from the Cadell Prison Farm. The footballers obviously enjoyed the chase; they
reportedly ran ‘whooping’ through the bush. The escapees promptly gave themselves up, later
saying that the noise of the search party ‘sounded like Maoris doing a war dance’. ‘3 Escapees

   From time to time, the Victorian government considered plans to expand the penal settlement on
French Island. On each occasion, after ‘spirited opposition’ from residents, the plans were shelved
(see, for instance: ‘The Reformation of Delinquents’, The Age, 8 May 1945). When the camp
finally closed in 1975, authorities claimed that a stabbing of a resident by an escapee had
influenced the decision (see Paul Heinrichs, ‘Sorry farewell to home-from-home’, The Age, 1 May
1975).

ANXIETY, STATISTICS, LANGUAGE


Administrators tried to calm residents and newspaper readers by emphasising the
infrequency of escape from the camps. In late 1932, for instance, A. T. Badger, the
Superintendent of Fremantle Prison reported that since the Pardelup Prison Farm opened
in 1927, 427 prisoners had passed through the institution, and of these only three had
escaped, all of whom had been quickly re-captured.26 Queensland CGP J. F. Whitney
announced that of the 2142 prisoners who had been confined at the state’s three prison
farms up to June 1947, only six had attempted to escape.27 Statistics like these bolstered
the image of the camps, and suggested the working of an enlightened penal policy: here
were prisons so benevolent that prisoners chose to remain imprisoned, even when there
was little to prevent them leaving. Shortly after the opening of the Kyeema Prison Camp
in February 1932, The Advertiser remarked:

likely meant ‘quod vide’. In Latin, the phrase means ‘which see’, and is used to direct readers to
further information, but it also has a punning effect, because ‘quod’ is a slang term for prison (see

         A prison from which prisoners do not want to escape still sounds a rather
         Gilbertian idea, even in these days of advanced penal reform, but it is
         exemplified in the State prison camp at Kyeema … No decent man would want to
         escape from the camp.28


Prisons departments used words as well as numbers to downplay concerns about escape.
Whitney felt that the six prisoners who had escaped from Queensland’s prison farms to
1947 had not really escaped. Each had instead made ‘an unauthorised departure from the
farm reserve’.29 In several states, administrators and politicians tried to reserve the word
‘escape’ for situations in which prisoners had overcome physical barriers to liberty, and
so referred to ‘absconders’ from prison camps rather than escapees.30 In 1955 Queensland
CGP Rutherford told an international penal conference that almost all escapes from
prison farms in his state were made by prisoners in the final weeks or even days of their
sentences. This, he thought ‘could be classified as falling to temptation rather than
premeditated escape’.31




ESCAPES RECONSIDERED

surprisingly little research on the topic. Criminologists have examined the subject in
recent years but historians have given the matter scant attention.32 Those historians who

have, present escapes, for the most part, as stories of ‘derring do’ or comedy, or limit
themselves to forensically describing how escapes were carried out.33 Two historians
have, however, demonstrated what can learnt by seriously considering escapes from the
point of view of the escapee.


Grace Karskens analysed the nature and meanings of escapes by convicts in early NSW,
and observed that they were regarded either ‘as stories of indomitable human spirit or as
evidence of unfathomable human stupidity’. Recaptured convicts, often Irish, told their
captors that they had been making for China, believing it to be only 150 miles north of
Sydney, on the far side of a river. There they thought they would be welcomed, and
invited to live, free from labour. This story was repeated so often that it became ‘a kind of
shorthand for the wild, irrational minds of the Irish’. But Karskens suggests there was
more to the ‘China story’. Convicts used it as a useful cover story for attempts to board
out-bound ships, and a way to minimise their punishment, by playing up to the image of
‘these clearly harmless, stupid creatures’. Some convicts no doubt believed that China
was close at hand, and others probably used it as synonym for any place beyond the
colony, but at least a few knew how to use the story to their advantage. By taking it at
face value, Karskens argues historians have perpetuated the stereotypes purveyed by the
colonial elite—that escapes showed convicts to be ‘incapable of rational thought’.
Looking at escapes from the convicts’ points of view suggests a different story. They
‘seemed to know the minds of those with power over them very well indeed’ and
exploited them with their deliberately obtuse geographies.34


The historian and sociologist Jacqueline Wilson found a similar unwillingness to
understand escapes from the perspective of the escapee when she conducted a survey of
prison museums across Australia. She found a pronounced tendency for escape stories to
be presented as ‘comic relief’ and, to illustrate her point, she recounted the case of Garry
David, also known as Garry Webb. David was a deeply disturbed man, who had been
abused, neglected and institutionalised from a very young age. He died aged thirty-eight,
having spent less than a year out of prison since he was seventeen. His crimes ranged
from petty theft to attempted murder. In the early 1990s David was confined in an annexe

to the Victorian prison system, the high-security J Ward of the now-defunct Ararat
Psychiatric Hospital. There, he removed the brickwork from his cell and squeezed
through into the adjacent stairwell. He found his way onto the roof, where he became
stuck. It would have been difficult and dangerous to bring David down by force, so the
staff at J Ward decided to wait. He stayed on the roof for three days.


The guide who showed Wilson around the site took pleasure in explaining how the
standoff was resolved. ‘It was the chops that got him down’, she said. On the third day a
meal of roast chops was prepared for the prisoners and the smell carried up to David: ‘he
couldn’t stand it, and out he came, for his dinner. So there you go; even Garry had a roast
dinner’. As Wilson points out, this telling of David’s actions implies a ‘benign
institutional wisdom and good-humoured paternalism’ on J Ward’s part, and elides the
reasons for David’s behaviour. ‘Good old J Ward, looking after even the maddest and
baddest—they can get natural up to their little bits of mischief, their escapades, and
what’s the response? Chops’. Wilson took issue with the way David’s desperate act was
‘euphemised’ into a trivial tourist attraction. ‘Whatever it was he was doing up in the roof
that day, or thought he was doing, it wasn’t comedy’.35


Following Karskens and Wilson, I would suggest that it is crucial to examine escapes
from the perspective of the escapee, even if this renders escapes less sensational or
amusing. It is moreover, instructive to consider what exactly escapees did while at large.
The analysis offered in this chapter is based on the collated records of 262 escapes from
prison camps around the country between 1917 and 1974. These records include official
reports, newspaper articles, departmental files, local histories, and prisoner memoirs and
biographies. I have interpreted this corpus in light of recent criminological research on
escapes from prison since the 1950s.




WHY PRISONERS ESCAPE


The historical and the criminological evidence both show that the two most common
reasons for escapes were family crisis, and fear of violence or victimisation. An
additional, smaller proportion of escapes might be best described as protests, or inebriated
misadventures.

Manne, (eds.), Reflected Light: La Trobe Essays, Black Inc, Melbourne, 2006, pp. 313, 319, 24.

                                               252

Family


In November 1972, a young girl in Western Australia working on a school project, wrote
to a psychologist in the Research Division at the Department of Corrections. ‘How do
you manage to keep the prisoners without them escaping?’ she asked. The psychologist
replied: ‘most inmates will only try to escape under extreme circumstances (trouble at
home for example) … You should not get the idea that all men in prison are dangerous,
desperate criminals: very few are like this’.36


Family crisis was perhaps the single most common reason prisoners escaped. Based on
interviews with 458 recaptured escapees, criminologist Barbara Thompson found that
‘chronic family problems’ precipitated thirty-one per cent of escapes from NSW prisons
in a seven year period.37 Similarly, using police and prison records that documented 812
escapes, Angela Gorta and Tony Sillivan found that forty-four per cent of those who
escaped from NSW prisons between 1983 and 1989 said that they were motivated by
illness in the family or estrangement from their partners. A further twenty-four per cent
cited other family problems, such as an unexpected and prolonged period of no letters or
visits from family, or that they felt family members needed their support.38


These figures are supported by the historical sources. When inmates heard that their
wives or girlfriends had left them or been unfaithful, when they heard that their children
were neglected or abused, when they heard that their parents were ill or dying, the urge to
see these people could be overwhelming. In March 1926, for instance, prisoner G. U.
escaped from French Island in a boat. After his recapture, he was anxious that his reasons
for escaping be understood. ‘I am a man who has always led a good life’, he told the ISB.


         This is my first time in gaol. I want you to understand this escape was prompted
         on the spur of the moment. I have had great trouble. My mother is very sick, and
         will not be long on this earth. I wanted to see her before she passed away …

        When I had seen my mother, whom I dearly love, I realized the seriousness of my
        action and then handed myself over.39


One man who escaped from the Glen Innes Afforestation Camp in 1930 told detectives he
escaped because he was concerned about his wife. She had at first visited him regularly in
prison but the visits had stopped, and although he had written to friends and family, he
had been unable to find out what had happened to her.40 A South Australian prisoner who
escaped from Kyeema Prison Camp in October 1951 said he wished to be with his mother
in Perth, who was seriously ill.41 When Queensland prisoner M. N. escaped from the
Numinbah Prison Farm in May 1952, having served over three-quarters of his sentence, it
was common knowledge among other prisoners that he had heard that his wife was living
with another man.42 Some prisoners even escaped in the knowledge they would be
recaptured and the hope that they would be transferred to different prisons, closer to their
families.43 Others escaped out of sheer loneliness.44


Prisoners are of course notorious for lying. By presenting themselves as caring sons and
devoted lovers, recaptured inmates may have been hoping to minimise the penalty they
were to receive for escaping. In other words, they might have been telling their own
version of ‘the China story’. However, the consistency of the historical record with the
criminological findings, along with the fact that there is no evidence to contradict the
inmates’ versions of events, suggests it would be cynical to discount these stories of
distress and grief.


Fear


Escapees were often portrayed as dangerous desperadoes. The truth is that many
prisoners were more concerned with avoiding violence directed at themselves than they
were with inflicting mayhem on innocent citizens. Thompson found that one in five
escapes from NSW prisons between 1985 and 1992 was prompted by threats of physical

or sexual violence from other inmates.45 Gorta and Sillivan found much the same thing.
Having examined the files of many escapees, they could not help but note the number of
requests for protection such prisoners made before they took flight. ‘In this light,
escaping may be seen as the prisoner’s way of dealing with a specific problem. Escaping
from custody is another way of being transferred’.46


Prison camps were much safer places than conventional prisons, but they were not free of
fighting between inmates. Violence, or the threat of it, was more than enough to make a
prisoner run away.47 ‘I am unpopular with other prisoners’, said a recaptured escapee and
informer as he explained, somewhat euphemistically, why he had fled from the McLeod
Settlement in 1925.48


Escape was also a favoured method of problem-solving for prisoners who were
homosexual, or were afraid of being seen as such. Though common in all prisons,
homosexual sex was—and is—proscribed in inmate culture. Consensual homosexual
relations were almost always kept secret, and fears of discovery could prompt prisoners to
escape. One such incident took place at the Hayes Prison Farm in 1945. In March,
Overseer Wilson reported that he had ‘reason to suspect’ two prisoners, R. S. and B. A. of
‘homosexual practices’. A., a young man, had been several times reproved for playfully
‘mauling’ other prisoners and lying on beds other than his own. S. was partial to A.’s
company and had tried to arrange work for the two of them at the Burnie Paper Pulp
works after their release. One evening in March, Wilson spoke ‘very severely’ to A.
about his behaviour, and the next day the two inmates escaped. S. was only a fortnight
away from the end of his sentence at the time, while A. had two and half months left to
serve. ‘It therefore seems unlikely that either would have risked the consequences of
escape without some special reason, such as immoral practices of which they are now
suspected’, Wilson said. If the two inmates were in a sexual relationship and it became
known, they faced the prospect of being transferred back to Hobart Gaol, assaulted by

   ‘Mansfield Murder. Conversations in Gaol’, The Argus, 9 July 1926. When several inmates at
Hayes Prison Farm assisted in the search for an escapee in 1938, another inmate who had spent
time in prison in Victoria was astonished. At Pentridge, he said, ‘the bastards would have their
guts kicked out’ for helping the authorities in such a way. See Overseer C. Wilson to Controller of
Prisons, 16 December 1938, AOT, Gaols Department, Individual Prisoners’ Files, 1891-1960,

other prisoners, and possibly prosecuted for their actions.49 Under the circumstances,
escape was an attractive proposition.50




Protest


Thompson found that five per cent of runaways escaped because they did not like their
new prison or camp, or did not want to be transferred. An additional small number
escaped in order to obtain medical treatment that had been refused to them in prison.51
These types of escapes might be characterised as a form of protest, and several such
incidents took place at camp, many during periods of overcrowding.52


In May 1948 two men escaped from Stone River State Farm, near Ingham in North
Queensland. Four days later, they were recaptured without a struggle. En route to
Townsville Prison after their capture, the escorting prison guard asked the men why they
had run off. One of the prisoners replied: ‘someone had to go, if it was not us two it
would be another two, someone had to fall for it’. The other escapee said that there had
been discontent at the farm for some time over a number of issues, particularly the issue
of tobacco, it being a number of months since any had been issued. The prisoners agreed
that they needed to attract the attention of head office to the matter, and drew lots ‘to see
who would shoot through to see if it would make good for the other prisoners’.53


Seven years later, five more prisoners escaped Stone River for similar reasons. According
to CGP Rutherford: ‘these men did not intend to escape in the true sense of the word, but
planned to return to H. M. Prison, Townsville, in melodramatic fashion, as a protest

against “conditions” at Stone River’. Several of these prisoners, some of whom were only
a matter of weeks from completing their sentences, complained of inadequate medical
treatment at the farm.54




Under the influence


Another category of escapees were induced to escape under the influence of alcohol,
and/or their fellow inmates. Thompson found that about ten per cent of the escapes in her
sample were made by prisoners who were intoxicated at the time.55 Inmates at camp often
brewed or improvised their own alcohol from farm crops or supplies.56 The two prisoners
who were selected to escape Stone River in 1948 were given a potent drink made from
methylated spirits, water, lemon juice and sugar cane to harden their resolve.57


Occasionally, prisoners would find or be supplied alcohol from outside, such as two
prisoners who went missing from the McLeod Settlement at Easter, 1919. A party of
visiting cricketers was on the island, and while a game was in progress the two inmates
discovered the boat that had brought the visiting sportsmen. In it they found a quantity of
food and several bottles of whisky. Such an opportunity was not to be missed. Late that
night, officers from the Settlement found the escapees stuck on a sandbar. ‘It’s all up’,
they said, before they were sent back to Pentridge.58 In May 1940, a young prisoner R. B.
escaped from Palen Creek under the influence of alcohol. He later referred to it as ‘my
foolish boyish escapade’.59

THE THREAT POSED BY ESCAPEES


Given the significance ascribed to escape rates, it is important to ask what happens after
prisoners made their escape. How often did they re-offend while at large, what sort of
offences did they commit on the run, and how much of a risk did they really represent?


The recent criminological evidence is consistent: almost all escapees—from prisons of all
types—were recaptured, most within a few days. Gorta and Sillivan found that almost
thirty per cent were recaptured on the day they escaped or the following day, and fully
half of all escapees were recovered within eight days.60 In WA in the years 1970-71, fifty-
five per cent of escapees were recaptured in two days. Just over five per cent remained at
large for more than twenty days.61


Of my sample of 262 escapes, only two prisoners—both from Queensland—are known to
have permanently avoided recapture. On a cloudy night in 1952 a short-term prisoner
absconded from the Palen Creek State Farm and never came within the reach of the law
again.62 And in 1960 a prisoner, J. H., rode out one wet-season evening to bring in the
cattle at the Stone River State Farm, and never came back.63


English criminologists Banks, Mayhew and Sapsford have pointed out that a certain
amount of crime is ‘a natural product of absconding—the men need shelter, food and
transport’. To obtain such things escaped prisoners generally have to break the law, ‘but
by and large they appear to constitute more of a nuisance than a danger’.64 Six out of ten
escapees from NSW prisons from 1974 to 1982 committed no proven offences while at

   Bell, Boyes and Jordan, ‘Escapes from Penal Institutions’, p. 6. English research found that two
thirds of the 235 escapees from open institutions in 1970 were apprehended within a week, and
that the median time at large was 2.5 days. Eighteen per cent were caught on the day they escaped.
Charlotte Banks, Patricia Mayhew and R. J. Sapsford, Absconding from Open Prisons, Her
Majesty’s Stationary Office, London, 1975, pp. 7, 46. Some escapees wanted only a brief period of
liberty. On the night of 15 August 1945, the day the allies declared victory in the Pacific, eight
prisoners from Pardelup felt compelled to join the celebrations. Several cans of cream from a
nearby farm disappeared, and a car went missing temporarily, but all prisoners involved were
present and correct at the muster the following morning. ‘Annual Report of the Comptroller
General of Prisons for the Year Ended 30th June, 1947’, pp. 9-10, Prisons, Annual Reports, Chief
Secretary’s Files, SROWA WAS 675, Con 752. In 1955 a number of homes in Penrith, near the
Emu Plains Prison Farm, were burgled. A complete set of fingerprints was found at the site of one
of offences, and police were surprised to find that they belonged to an inmate then serving a
sentence at the prison farm. ‘Prisoners in pubs at night’, The Sun, 21 April 1955.

large.65 Gorta and Sillivan found that just under seventy-five per cent of escapees in NSW
between 1983 and 1989 committed no proven offence while at large, and that of the 812
escapes in this period, only thirty-nine involved offences against the person.66 In the
sample of 262 escapes, only five such offences are documented.


The low rate of violent offending by escapees is consistent with pre-escape profiles.
Contrary to popular belief, prisoners with violent records have been the least likely to
attempt to escape. Gorta and Sillivan found that ‘a typical escapee from NSW gaols’ in
the mid-1980s was under twenty-four years old, serving time for a property offence such
as break and enter, or car theft.67 Researchers in New Zealand have compiled ‘composite
impressionist descriptions’ of escapees and non-escapees from prisons in that country in
the 1950s. They too found that violent offenders were less likely to escape than non-
violent prisoners.68 Unaware of such findings, local residents were most concerned about
the proximity of prisoners with violent records. In 1959, for instance, the New Norfolk
Council wrote to the Tasmanian Prisons Department to ask that the farm be used to hold
‘the milder types of prisoners only, and that the dangerous types be retained at the Hobart
Gaol’.69 Ironically, the risk the community faced from escapees, such as it was, came
more from ‘the milder types’ than it did from the few murderers and rapists at the farm.


Most escapees posed a threat only to themselves. Many of the camps were located in
isolated places, and surrounded by rugged terrain.70 Escapees often became lost, and

the 235 abscondees from English open institutions in 1970 only two were serving a sentence for a
crime of violence; one of these was recaptured on the day he escaped, the other was picked up
after five days. Only twelve per cent were reported as having committed offences while on the run,
and all were property offences. This pattern reflected the crimes for which the escapees had been
originally convicted. By far the greatest escape risk was posed by burglars (4.7% risk), followed
by thieves (3.1%). Researchers found that the likelihood of escape by men convicted of crimes
involving sex or violence was 1.7%. Banks, Mayhew and Sapsford, Absconding from Open

opposition, pressed the Chief Secretary about a spate of recent escapes from Pardelup Prison
Farm. Watts pointed out that one of the prisoners involved was serving a sentence for incest and
another for robbery committed with violence. ‘What justification can be advanced for allowing
these prisoners to be at Pardelup in a closely settled district…where women and children are
frequently left without protection?’ Watts asked. Parliamentary Debates: Legislative Council and

suffered from hunger, exposure and exhaustion. Many gave themselves up when it
became too much, others became so thoroughly disoriented that they could not find
anyone to give themselves up to. After his recapture, a young escapee from Emu Plains
told police ‘an amazing story of his vicissitudes, sleeping in the bush and in small caves
during the tempestuous weather which prevailed’.71 Another NSW escapee suffered
chronic health problems associated with his privations while at large in 1937.72 In 1966,
The first words spoken by an escapee recovered from rugged country around Glenn Innes
were: ‘thank heavens that’s over’.73


Escape was a particularly risky business for escapees from the island camps on St Helena
and French Island. Although a foolhardy few tried to escape the McLeod Settlement by
swimming, boats were the key to getting off the island. Several prisoners drowned as they
made their way to the mainland on improvised rafts. In April 1938, for instance, prisoner
J.M. escaped on a vessel made from some empty drums and planks lashed together with
rope. The seas were heavy, and police inferred his fate when a number of items washed
ashore near Corinella, including a broken paddle, half a loaf of bread, a tin of jam, and a
pair of the prisoner’s boots.74


There was hardship even for those prisoners who failed to get off the island. A substantial
number of escapees from McLeod were unable to steal or build a vessel after their initial
flight. Some eventually gave up and trudged back, tired and hungry, to the camp.75

subsisted on green figs and quinces for three days before giving himself up.76 Seven
months later, prisoner W. E. was on the loose on the island for ten days. With all the
boats on the island either locked up or closely monitored he was unable to reach the
mainland. Local residents and prisons staff were puzzled as to how he held out so
long—apart from fruit the only foodstuffs available were rabbits and snakes.77


Very occasionally escapees from camps would behave dangerously, and put staff and
their fellow prisoners at risk. In June 1967, two inmates at Hayes Prison Farm set a fire to
create a distraction while they made their escape. Several buildings were damaged or
destroyed, and two prisoners were seriously injured by falling timber during the blaze.78
But of all the escapes connected with prison camps, only one had truly terrible
consequences for anyone other than the escapees, and this was a break-in rather than a
break-out. In 1959, in one of the most famous twentieth-century Australian prison
escapes, Leslie Newcombe and Kevin Simmonds escaped from Long Bay Prison in
Sydney, and subsequently went in search of a firearm. They were familiar with Emu
Plains and its routines, and planned to overpower the night guard there and steal his
weapon. The officer, Cecil Mills, was killed in the ambush.79



Escapees and sexual panic


For all the anxiety of locals, women and girls living near the camps faced little threat of
sexual violence from inmates. I have found only two substantiated examples of incidents
involving local women or girls and prisoners beyond the boundaries of the prison.

In 1965, Darcy Dugan was confined at the Mannus Afforestation Camp in the Southern
Tablelands of NSW.80 Although Dugan was a notorious gaol breaker—between 1946 and
1950 he made ten attempts to escape custody and succeeded four times81—by the mid-
1960s he was well into middle-age. He had served fifteen years of a life sentence, and
prison authorities were preparing to release him, following a recommendation from the
Minister of Justice. Dugan had not been at the camp long, however before he struck up a
friendship with a local woman he met during a cricket game between prisoners and locals
at the camp. She informed him that a number of the prisoners slipped out of their huts at
night to meet wives or girlfriends in the surrounding bush. Most of the guards, she said,
were happy to turn a blind eye. Another prisoner told Dugan of a car hidden nearby that
some of the prisoners used on their night jaunts, and invited him to do the same.82


         Darcy was all fired up. He knew the consequences if he got caught, but he could
         never resist playing close to the wire. After all, nobody was going to get hurt. He
         only wanted to do what came naturally, and follow what everyone else was doing
         anyway. It was surely just another logical step towards his rehabilitation, wasn’t
         it?83


Dugan got away with visiting his ‘friend’ for over three months. During this time he and
other prisoners drove as far as Wagga, even attending the dog races, at which Dugan
apparently had a fair bit of luck. One night however, he stayed out so late that he did not
have time to hide the car, which was then noticed the next morning by the wife of one of
the warders. The subsequent controversy seriously embarrassed the Prisons Department
and pushed Dugan’s parole date back significantly.84

a similar incident at Hayes Prison Farm. One prisoner managed to create a well disguised trapdoor
in the floor of his hut. He was sighted at night by police in Hobart, Glenorchy and other places, but
was always in his hut by morning. At a loss to explain how the prisoner got out, Thorne said the
inmate ‘nearly sent everybody mad’. ‘Prison Without Locks’, Mercury 27 July 1970.

The second substantiated case occurred in September 1966. The daughter of a farmer
whose property was adjacent to the Palen Creek State Farm was caught by her father as
she came home late one night. The farmer did not see anyone else, but heard the sounds
of someone running in the direction of the prison farm. The girl admitted to her father
that she had been with prisoner T. M. several times over the course of the previous three
months, and that they had slept with each other on one occasion. The father did not want
the matter publicly known but as the girl admitted the act, and was fifteen years old at the
time, senior prison officials felt bound to put the matter into the hands of the police.
Although the department did not regard M., who was twenty-two, as a security risk, he
was returned to Brisbane Prison. There were no witnesses, so there was insufficient
evidence to charge him with escaping, but the police proceeded with a charge of carnal
knowledge of a girl under sixteen years. M. declared he loved the girl and wanted to
marry her upon his release, but was found guilty and sentenced to another two years in
prison. At the time his relationship with the girl was discovered, his release date was only
two months away. In the course of his second sentence, he developed a malignant form of
lung cancer and died.85


In having sex with an underage girl, M. had clearly committed a serious offence. But this
situation is a far cry from the image of rampant sexual predators that local residents
feared. If he and Dugan indicate the overall threat to the women and girls living near the
camps, then the threat was greatly exaggerated. Admittedly, there must have been similar
or worse cases for which the relevant records have been lost or destroyed (if they ever
existed). Dugan said he was only copying other prisoners, but extensive surveys of
newspapers and official records reveal few suggestions of any sort of contact between
prisoners and local women, and no clear-cut cases of sexual violence.86 Both the prisons

Telegraph, 16 September 1966.
86
   There are reports of a number of cases similar to Dugan’s in that they involved prisoners
joyriding and drinking by night and returning by dawn. See for instance: ‘Night Forays Of ‘Escape
Club’ at Prison Farm’, Truth, 17 February 1952; ‘Escapee tells of car jaunts from jail farm’, The
Sun, 16 March 1952; ‘Prisoners in pubs at night’; Ruth Gooch, Frontier French Island, Prahan
Mechanics Institute Press, Melbourne, 2006, p. 199. There are several unsubstantiated reports of
similar ‘interactions’ with locals, although these appear relatively harmless. One of the more
remarkable accounts concerns events at Stone River in May 1948. A number of prisoners allegedly
made an appearance at a dance at the Upper Stone River community hall, dressed in regulation
Queensland prison service uniforms. One of the prisoners at the farm had been entrusted with the
task of doing the guards’ laundry, and it was alleged that he ‘loaned’ the garments to his fellow
prisoners for the purpose of attending the dance. Upon hearing about the matter, the Under-
Secretary to the Attorney General, J. D. O’Hagen, wrote to his Minister, ‘one can imagine the
resentment of parents in the Ingham district if they found that their daughters were dancing with
prisoners from the State Farm’. The Attorney immediately dispatched the Comptroller General to

                                              263

departments and the families involved would of course have tried to keep such incidents
as quiet as possible, but prisons are powerful rumour mills. The lack of information about
any further incidents is telling.


In 1927, B. A. De La Haye, the disgruntled resident of French Island, complained that the
women of the island were at constant risk from the prisoners. This prompted a swift reply
from other residents. De La Hayes’ statement that ‘the women and children live in
constant fear of molestation is altogether incorrect’, the Secretary of the French Island
Progress Association wrote. ‘They never give the prisoners a thought .. .they would laugh
at the idea of such a fear. One, or even two, women may be nervous when left alone at
night, but there are hundreds of them in Melbourne also’.87


The discreet, unauthorised entry of prisoners’ partners to the camp property was much
more common than the prisoners leaving to maraud the neighbourhood. During the
investigation into T. M.’s relationship with the neighbour’s daughter, M.’s mother wrote
to Peter Delamothe, the Minister for Justice, and hinted at other, unreported matters:
‘believe me the things my son has told me … could cause a big stir if I decide to write to
Truth’.88 A friend of M.’s spelt matters out to the Minister:


        [M.] never opened his mouth about the married men’s wives, going down one
        evening every now and then to visit their husbands. He should have as they
        ribbed him about not doing so.89


In 1967 a prisoner at the McLeod Settlement attested to the fact that ‘conjugals’ took
place on the beach near the camp.90 In May 1975 a report appeared in the Tasmanian
press about women, in the summer months, keeping ‘clandestine appointments in one
sector of the farm which had lush growth’.91 These stories of unauthorised visits are

Stone River to investigate. Based on some confusion in the prisoners’ stories, and the assurances
of the warders, the Comptroller decided that the allegations were unfounded; see O’Hagan to

were ten to twelve miles [sixteen to nineteen kilometres] from the camp, making them ‘as remote

consistent with the frequency with which prisoners escaped for family reasons: most
prisoners were much more interested in their wives and girlfriends than they were in the
girl next-door.




Making good on the run


In 1938, a representative of the Victorian penal service spoke to a reporter about escapes.
Escapes were quite uncommon, he said, and almost all of those who did get away were
quickly recaptured. ‘Of those never heard of again it is surely fair to assume that the
Penal Department has accomplished what it set out to do for them—to make them self-
respecting members of society.92 This remark is not quite as absurd as it appears at first
glance. Of the prisoners who managed to remain at large for any length of time after
escaping from camp, a few did establish themselves in civil society again.


W. I. escaped from the McLeod Settlement in October 1917. He quickly made his way to
Adelaide, where, for eleven weeks, he worked at a number of jobs. After his recapture
and return to Victoria, he claimed one of the Forestry inspectors on French Island had
told him that if he made it beyond Victoria’s borders he would not be returned.93 In 1944,
a former inmate of the Emu Plains Prison Farm was recaptured near Wollongong, nearly
twenty years after he absconded. In the interim he had raised nine children.94 A prisoner
who escaped from Palen Creek prison farm in 1960 was at large for three years, much of
which he spent in legal employment in Sydney, without coming to the attention of police.
His history and identity only came to light when he was arrested on a charge of offensive
language.95


In 1951 prisoner O. O. escaped the Stone River State Farm, and gave blood to the Red
Cross in Brisbane before finding work as a cattleman. He was the first prison farm
escapee in Queensland in three years, and in the words of the CGP ‘a model prisoner …

and one of the most trusted prisoners at Stone River’. He had moreover, ‘expressed
himself as being finished with crime’. He remained at large for six and a half months. The
station manager who employed O. saw a photograph of him in a newspaper shortly after
hiring him. Instead of turning him in, the manager said he was very pleased with the
escapee’s work, and burnt the report of the escape. O. confided that he wished to make
out for Alice Springs; the manager told him that he could work overtime if he wanted to
earn the necessary money faster. The two men arranged to keep a record of the extra
hours worked and agreed that O. would be paid when he left for the Northern Territory.
‘That money,’ he later wrote, ‘was to be my nest egg’. He worked up to sixteen hours a
day, and often on weekends, on everything ‘from fencing to firefighting’—labour little
different to that he would have been required to do at the prison farm. He was arrested
just a few days before he was due to depart, after his employer informed police of his
whereabouts. ‘It was because I was leaving him in a few days and my usefulness was
over as far as he was concerned, and also he would not have to pay the money due to me’.
After his recapture, he sought the assistance of the Prisons Department in recovering the
wages due to him, without success.96


One remarkable escapee from St Helena Prison Farm made good in a different country,
and later returned to Queensland voluntarily, to serve out the remainder of his sentence.
In 1929, John Stelling swam to a dinghy tethered to a buoy, a short distance from the
island. After rowing to the mainland, he went to Sydney. He was an engineer by trade,
and secured a berth as an engine hand on a steamer heading for London. He later said that
after several years living a law-abiding life in England, he became ‘unhappy in the
knowledge that I was a fugitive from justice and my varying fortunes convinced me that I
would have been wiser to have served out the remaining four months of my sentence’.97
He returned to Australia, and, on 27 September 1934 gave himself up at Boggo Road
Gaol. The superintendent recognised him and declared ‘Why, you’re John Stelling … I
would have thought that this was the last place for you to visit’. Stelling replied: ‘Yes …
I want to get this whole business over with. What do I have to do?’ He was officially
released after serving the remaining four months plus an extra two and a half for the theft
of the dingy and the destruction of the padlock on his cell door.98

Gorta and Sillivan have also reported the case of a prisoner who escaped custody in NSW
in 1986. While at large he had set up a business as a scrap merchant and considered his
time at large as ‘the most stable period of his life’.99



ESCAPES AND PENAL POLICY


The facts that almost all escapees from prison camps were quickly recaptured, that most
were not dangerous, and that they usually escaped for unthreatening reasons never made
an impression on public debate. After the event, some locals would call for the camp to
be shut down or moved, and escapes did contribute to the closure of at least two camps.
Others demanded that prisoners be better screened, or that security be increased.100


In practice, it was impossible to screen out potential escapees in the selection process.
Criminologists have tried, without success, to find ways to identify likely escapees.
‘While escapees do differ from the gaol population as a whole,’ Gorta and Sillivan wrote,
‘they do not differ so markedly that their characteristics can be used to predict escapees in
advance’.101 Confusingly for officials, many of those who did escape were regarded as
model prisoners until they ran off. When R. C. escaped the Hayes Prison Farm in April
1938 (alarming Mr and Mrs Terry in the process), Overseer Carl Wilson was puzzled:
‘his behaviour had been excellent. There does not appear to be any reason why he cleared
out as he had said previously he liked his job’.102 Even in the period when officers read
prisoners’ mail, prisoners escaped for no reason recognisable to officials.


More confusingly still, many of these well-behaved prisoners escaped when they had
almost completed their sentences, a phenomena known in prison as ‘gate fever’103 J. W.,
for instance, escaped French Island in December 1926. He had only six months left to

serve on his long sentence, and had been so trustworthy he was assigned work on the
prison boat.104 In 1948, inmate D. Y. escaped from Numinbah prison farm with less than
four weeks still to serve. ‘I very much regret the foolish impulse which led me to make
the escape’, he said later. A double murderer escaped from Glenn Innes Afforestation
camp in NSW in May 1966, having served eighteen years of a life sentence, with his
release due for consideration in only a matter of months.105 The escape of J. H. from
Stone River in 1960 was particularly confounding. He had been a well-trusted prisoner,
and had less than six months to serve on his two-year sentence for breaking, entering and
stealing. Staff placed so much trust in him that they did not even consider the possibility
that he had escaped until quite some time after his absence was noted, believing instead
that he was lost or hurt. ‘His conduct,’ the puzzled officer-in-charge reported, ‘had been
exemplary’.106 Reviewing the five escapes from Queensland’s prison farms between
January 1947 and June 1948, CGP J. Whitney said ‘the incomprehensible feature of these
incidents is that each prisoner concerned had only a very short part of his sentence
remaining to be served’.107

Escapes, 1942-63, QSA, Series 9097, Item 293123. After a luckless search for J. H. in the rugged,
rain-soaked mountain country around Ingham, it came to light that one of H.’s fellow prisoners
had known of the escape plan. This man, who was due for discharge a week after the escape was
to take place, arranged to meet H. near Charters Towers, with supplies of food and clothes. Police
lay in wait at this place on the appointed day, but H. did not appear. The subsequent search of the
area suggested he had never been there at all, and that he and his co-prisoner had staged an
effective diversion. The prisoners’ rumour mill muddied the waters still further; some reported
hearing that H. had been taken in by a group of Aboriginal people and that he had tinted his hair
and skin with black dye; other reports placed him as far away as Melbourne. Newspapers across
north Queensland carried descriptions of him, his photograph was printed and shown by police to
hundreds of local residents. After the initial search failed to uncover any trace of him, the CGP
still claimed he was confident H. would eventually be recaptured. But H. entered folklore in the
north as the ‘Phantom Prisoner’. For years afterwards, local newspapers would mark the
anniversary of his escape with the news that there was no news on the man. Occasionally someone
matching his description would be seen working on stations in the far west of the State; each time
police returned empty-handed and red-faced. File of escapee J. H., Special Subject Batches,

Men Escape from Prison Camp’, SMH, 11 November 1930. Even escapees themselves sometimes
found it difficult to explain their actions. The first escapee from Kyeema Prison Camp was unable
to say why he had absconded, and said he had been ‘well treated’ at the camp. ‘Escaped Prisoner
Gives Himself Up’, The Advertiser, 29 November 1934).

                                               268

Unable to predict which prisoners would escape, administrators came under heavy
pressure to change security and supervision arrangements at the camps. Publicly, they
claimed that they would not modify prison camp policy on the basis of incidents of
escape. After the escape of prisoner A. B. from Kyeema Prison Camp in August 1937,
South Australian Chief Secretary Ritchie insisted that the camp was functioning as it
ought and ‘the escape today will make no difference to our future policy’.108 Likewise, in
1952, Queensland CGP William Rutherford stated that:


        It may be that one or two of these men will abscond, but if a positive policy of
        rehabilitation is considered desirable in the best interests of the State and the
        individual concerned, certain risks must be taken. There is a great temptation in
        prison administration, especially when things go wrong, as they frequently do, to
        retreat from a positive policy to a defensive or negative policy. While this attitude
        may reduce the worries of prison administrators, it also evades the responsibility
        placed upon them by the State and community, which rightly expect that
        everything possible will be done too assist a prisoner to eventually find a useful
        place in the community.109


But despite administrators’ reassurances to the contrary, escapes did force departments to
alter their practice, if not their stated policy. When the camps were still in their infancy,
the authorities threatened to abandon the innovation completely if escapes got out of
hand.110 In 1920, an unnamed warden from Pentridge complained about the effects of
cracking down on prisoners after an escape attempt: ‘The pity of an affair like this escape
business … is that it means tightening up in the shops and going back years in prison
reform’.111


A number of prisoners escaped from the McLeod Settlement in August 1923. After they
were recaptured, they were told by a police magistrate: ‘The fact that you have broken

faith … will make conditions more difficult for everyone on the island’.112 When huts
replaced dormitories at Hayes Prison Farm in 1949, they were at first unlocked.113
Controller Scanlan told the inmates that locks would be attached if they took advantage of
the lack of security. But, as an officer who worked at the farm at the time remembered,
‘some of the silly devils still escaped—so we had locks for the first time’.114 Roy Grubb,
a magistrate who led an inquiry into the Tasmanian prison system in 1976, thought that
the ‘intemperate, extravagant and sensational’ media reportage of escapes drove the penal
administration to become overcautious about using medium and minimum security
divisions.115 And as late as 1992, Helen Holland, a former Governor of the Morwell River
Reafforestation Camp in Victoria expressed her frustration that


        even after thirty-one years of operation some members of the public still cannot
        come to terms with the concept of an open camp as such. The initial freedom
        granted to prisoners has been eroded because of the occasional escape.116


Thus, escapees had, arguably, much stronger effects on other inmates than on local
communities.117 Prisoners themselves certainly begrudged the restrictive procedures that
nervous administrators put in place to reduce escapes from camps.118 Peter Wayne was a
prisoner at an English open camp in Suffolk in the 1960s, not long after a rash of
sensational escapes. He explained that:


        Psychologically, the prisoner moves back to his childhood when faced with the
        pernickety regimes. He soon learns that within his apparent freedom, he must
        report here, there, everywhere, at impossibly difficult times, to a succession of
        different parades, roll calls, dining halls, workshops, welfare offices, wages huts,
        and even formally laid out kit inspections. I dare say all this is necessary (for the

        ‘prison’ must be seen to retain a modicum of discipline—these are after all places
        of punishment), but it does provoke in the prisoner a resentment of authority
        which led, in my own case, to an early morning ‘ghosting’ from idyllic highpoint
        in Suffolk, and my eventual return to the rigours and radiating spokes of
        Wandsworth.119


Increased discipline and surveillance at camps failed to reduce rates of escape. On the
contrary, since the 1960s, the numbers of prisoners escaping has risen dramatically.120
The reasons for this increase are not entirely clear. It certainly has something to do with
changes in the number and type of prisoners held at the camps after the war, and the
increasing availability of motor vehicles. Thomas and Stewart argue that escape rates rose
as the novelty of the camps wore off:


        the excitement of the new venture wears off and new generations of prisoners are
        no longer grateful for the opportunity they are being given. The open prison
        becomes a normal variant on the system … An early claim of the builders of
        open prisons is that there are no escapes. This soon changes, and the beginning
        and the increase of escapes is a sure sign that the prison is entering a new phase
        in its career.121


Still, the increased rates of escape in the second half of the twentieth century were low
relative to comparable and well-regarded penal systems. In the mid-1970s, Sweden’s
prison population was approximately 3200, roughly the same as that in NSW. At the
time, there were an average of two hundred Swedish prisoners unaccounted for on any
one day; in NSW there were sixty-two. When asked about the Swedish system, NSW
CGP Walter McGeechan said: ‘My impression is that right across Scandinavia they place
no real importance on escape’.122

Given that their attempts to reduce escape rates met with limited, if any success,
administrators might perhaps have been better off encouraging citizens and politicians to
tolerate a certain frequency of escape. And indeed there is a long line of alternative
thought on escapes, perhaps related to the Australian sympathy for successful rogues. The
1899 Royal Commission into Western Australian prisons held that escapes were among
other things, ‘a sign of positive energy in the inmate, which should not be punished
harshly’.123 In 1923, the Queensland Home Secretary said that ‘a prisoner is under no real
obligation to remain in gaol if he can get out’. He regarded the loss of remission and the
serving of the remainder of the original sentence sufficient deterrents that no extra
penalty need apply.124 In 1933, in the Court of Criminal Appeals in Melbourne, the judge
told a prisoner charged with escaping from custody that ‘in some circumstances, escaping
from custody is not a very serious matter. If a gate is left open, then one cannot blame a
man very much for escaping’.125 Former NSW CGP John Morony thought that stories of
daring escapes from P.O.W. camps during the Second World War had softened some
people’s attitudes to escape from civilian prisons. ‘I will recall a very senior Law
Minister affirming that escaping was a natural, not a criminal, activity,’ Morony wrote.126
In 1963 a young prisoner enjoyed a brief period of freedom after he survived a six-hour
swim from the McLeod Settlement to the mainland. In sentencing him to only one
month’s extra imprisonment, Judge Rapke said that he had shown ‘misplaced courage’,
adding ‘that sort of spirit is good if it is turned to a useful purpose’.127

Widespread but inaccurate stereotypes about escapees have supported a near-universal
agreement that rates of escape were—and are—essential measures of the performance of

a prisoner just escaped from Pardelup Prison Farm managed to talk his way onto the return flight

the prisons. Yet in terms of public safety, escapes from prison camps have been relatively
inconsequential. There was little to laugh at or to fear in them. They were simply
acts—sometimes desperate, occasionally quite rational—committed by people in difficult
circumstances and with very limited options. Prisoners escaped from camp for reasons
fully comprehensible to non-prisoners: family problems, fear, or foolishness. And after
they escaped, they did not go on violent rampages. For the most part, they were promptly
caught. A handful of escapees managed to stay at large and some of these even managed
to find respectable employment. Criminological research has helped define the risk
presented by escapees; history can give the statistics a context and remind us that the
numbers represent real people strikingly similar to ourselves.


Those charged with the making of penal policy have been well aware of these facts.
Giving testimony before the Nagle Royal Commission in July 1976, McGeechan
admitted ‘it could well be conceivable that we overstate the importance of escape’. Paul
Stein, counsel assisting the Commission pointed out that McGeechan had, in December
1974, told the press about ‘two desperate, vicious criminals’ who had recently escaped
from Long Bay. ‘Did you also say at the same time,’ Stein added, ‘the community is at
severe risk from escaping prisoners’? McGeechan conceded he had, whereupon Stein
asked if it was ‘important to tell the people what the real facts are about prisoners
escaping from prison camps’, McGeechan replied: ‘well, more importantly, it is
important to reduce the number of people running away from prison camps … I am
conscious that there is a great deal of community concern about prisoners running
away’.128 Like many of those charged with making penal policy, McGeechan was
influenced more by unfounded fears than he was by the facts.

              Penal Reform and Prison Camp Officers

        against any tender sentiment.

        fascinating, rewarding, stimulating and so essentially human.

In March 2009, Ron Woodham, NSW the Commissioner for Corrective Services, told a
parliamentary inquiry that two of the state’s prisons should be privatised. Security was so
lax that prisoners had escaped while officers in the monitor room were watching cricket
on television, he said. Staff had also caused a twenty million dollar blow-out in overtime
expenses by ‘manipulating’ timesheets and rosters. If private interests had operated these
prisons in a similar fashion then ‘they would almost certainly would be put out for
retender’. In his view, the industrial power of the officers’ union made it much more
difficult to reform state-operated prisons because union officials threatened industrial
action whenever management tried to ‘change anything in the prisons’. Individual
officers who cooperated with management were physically intimidated by their co-
workers. When prisoner numbers had to be reduced at one of the prisons in question,

Woodham had the prisoners shifted en masse in the dead of night without the knowledge
of the prison staff, or the union. Officers denied the allegations of misconduct, and
protested the proposed privatisations by walking off the job. They argued that Woodham
sought to privatise the prisons not to improve security or reduce expenses but to erode the
power of the prison officers’ union, and pursue an ideological commitment to the
privatisation of state assets.4


The controversy threw into relief the difficult, and vital, position of prisons staff in
relation to reform, and reinforced a number of stereotypes about prison staff in general.
Officers were represented as self-serving stumbling blocks, uninterested in the welfare of
prisoners and concerned only in protecting their conditions. This image is not exactly
baseless. Prison officers, often those active in the union, have reactively opposed change
in the past.5 But prison officers are not uniformly intransigent, and nor do the unions
speak for all prisons staff.


The Australian prisons services have employed many people deeply interested in, and
committed to, the reform of prisons and the rehabilitation of prisoners. The history of the
Australian prison camps sheds light on several of these individuals. The officers-in-
charge at the prison camps between 1913 and about 1940 implemented reform diligently,
even where their own working conditions became more difficult as a result. Importantly,
the fact that they were to be found at the camps in these years was not a coincidence.

  When Tony Vinson was appointed to lead the NSW prisons service in 1979, with the
recommendations of a Royal Commission for a mandate, he encountered what he called a ‘long
standing culture’ of hostility to change within the ranks. Prisons staff thought that ‘they and they
alone should be free to decide what should be done to prisoners’. Vinson sought to extend due
process to prisoners in their disputes with officers, but when unrest struck Parramattta Prison a
union official told him: ‘You’ve had your troubles with us since coming here. All that can be put
right tonight. It can end. Just let us go in there and belt the shit out of them.’ On another occasion,
Vinson said ‘I was solemnly reminded by the union “You must uphold our version of what
happened. That’s your duty as our commander”.’ Vinson, ‘Reforming Prisons: A 1970s

weapon to frustrate Vinson’s agenda. For the thoughts of an insider on the culture of the Victorian

When penal reform created genuinely new opportunities and roles for these officers, they
responded. Conversely, the increasing difficulties experienced at the camps in the second
half of the twentieth century can be connected to a decline in the calibre of the officers
placed at the camps.




THE VOICE OF THE GUARD6


Historians have paid a good deal of attention to reform-minded comptrollers and
politicians, but very little to the custodial staff who personally interacted with prisoners
on a daily basis. Yet those in the head offices were often the first to admit the crucial part
played by their most junior employees.7 John Ramsland stated his intention to ‘recreate as
accurately and as vividly as possible the daily life and work’ of staff, as well as prisoners,
in his history of the NSW prisons.8 But he focussed on the published views of the
comptrollers-general and a few governors, not on the work and opinions of subordinate
custodial staff. Interestingly, even those writers, such as John Morony, Jim Armstrong
and Jonathan Telfer, who were employed by the prisons services, have little to say about
staffing matters, preferring to focus on changing penal architecture and theory.9 The
British penal officer has been better represented in the literature, but even there, as J. E.
Thomas has noted, most of the interest has centred on prisoners and senior prison
6
  In this chapter (and indeed in the thesis as a whole), I have used the terms ‘guard’ and ‘officer’
interchangeably, but officers themselves have been very sensitive to language. Partly for this
reason penal nomenclature changes regularly. ‘Turn-keys’ became ‘warders’, who became ‘prison
guards’, who in turn became ‘penal officers’ before most recently becoming ‘correctional
officers’. In 1968, one Victorian officer complained that the press still referred to custodial staff as
warders, when they were gazetted as prison officers. ‘We are justifying our names, but how can
we let the community know?’ ‘Turnkeys, Warders, Prison Officers?’, The Victorian Prison
Officers’ Journal, August 1968, p. 10. NSW CGP Walter McGeechan admitted that the change
‘may be aesthetic, I don’t know’, but insisted that staff ‘feel more comfortable’ with the new
terms. Proceedings of the Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons, vol. 9, Government
Printer, Sydney, 1978, p. 362; also W. M. English, ‘The Effect of Prison Work on Staff’, paper

administrators.10 Séan McConville was astonished by the number of works concerned
with penal change which passed over,


        with only the most cursory examination, the capacities and reaction of those
        whose duty it is to apply the new dispensation; despite the fact that time and
        again instances emerge where the practical problems of management and the
        exigencies of staffing have substantially altered policy.11


The experiences of those who worked in the lower rungs of the prisons services are
difficult to research. The officers who have most openly expressed their views have
typically been those who rose to the top of their profession.12 Beyond the walls, guards’
voices have, if anything, been heard even less than those of the inmates. They have
certainly felt a powerful urge to talk about their work in private—most ‘have a
compulsion to talk about the prison, prisoners and management almost to the exclusion of
all else’, according to Pat Merlo, a former officer in the Victorian prisons service.13
Talking publicly about working life is quite a different matter however. William
McGrath, a former Governor of Pentridge Prison, wrote the foreword to Merlo’s book,
and while he praised Merlo’s honesty, he added, with a touch of ambiguity: ‘she has
revealed herself to the world, a step many of us would be loathe to take.’14


The accounts of those who did speak publicly are generally of two types, the first of
which is a series of amusing or scandalising anecdotes. The strange foibles of prison life
are related in colourful sketches, which typically labour the platitude that ‘crime doesn’t
pay’, and express a weary bemusement with the perennial inability of criminals to
recognise this simple fact.15 The second type of account is that of the disgruntled former
employee. These individuals usually have axes to grind against their former employers,

and their purpose is to shock and outrage.16 Both types of memoir tell us a good deal
about the life of officers in closed prisons, but we have no accounts by authors who
worked in the prison camps. Moreover, neither variety of memoir illuminates the way in
which grand penological theories turned on the small exigencies of guards’ working lives.


To glimpse the experience of staff working at prison camps one must turn to archival
sources. Access to personnel documents is no simple matter, however, and almost as
difficult to arrange as access to prisoner files. Many records are incomplete or lost. I have
therefore complemented the slim body of memoirs and scraps of archival information
with the impressions of those who came into contact with the officers—senior staff,
journalists, and prisoners.




‘ … YOU CAN NEVER BE REPLACED’: OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE, 1913–c.1940


We have done a disservice to prison officers with our predilection to caricature the penal
past. It is often assumed that, in ‘the bad old days’, prison staff were all vindictive thugs,
or active sadists. Like the broad arrow, leg irons and floggings, brutal officers are useful
shorthand for the horrors of the penal past, whether real or imagined.17


The first generation of the officers-in-charge (those employed at the camps between 1913
and the 1940s) were dedicated, carefully selected individuals who believed in the aims of
the prison farm movement.18 Neighbouring residents, colleagues in the services and even
prisoners agreed that they were unusually competent. J. J. Manning for instance, the OIC
at Emu Plains, strongly impressed a visiting local resident in 1917: ‘we have never met a
more courteous, and better accredited officer and supervisor of such an institution than
Mr Manning, who is beyond doubt, the right man in the right place.’19

   Morony thought that the smooth workings of the camps in their early years owed much to the
careful selection of ‘wise, calm and tolerant officers’. The More Things Change, p. 507. Former
Superintendent, Roy Stephenson joined the Queensland prison service in 1936. Many of the
officers he met then, including camp officers, had ‘strong feelings of compassion for numbers of
the people in their charge’ and made up for a lack of education with ‘commonsense … and moral
fibre’. Nor Iron Bars a Cage, p. 10.

Bill O’Connor was the first OIC at Palen Creek prison farm. Shortly after the farm was
established, a visiting journalist reported that the inmates looked on O’Connor ‘rather as
a friend than a gaoler’.20 Tom King was a thoughtful young officer in the 1950s when he
encountered O’Connor, by then the Superintendent at Boggo Road prison, and King
thought him ‘as fine a man as I ever encountered in or out of the prison system … a
gentle, no nonsense, non-intrusive man … He was a leader in the wider community as
well as a good superintendent.’21 King said that, as he moved through the ranks,
O’Connor remained a role model, along with Allan Whitney, the founding OIC at Stone
River.22


Some prisoners and their families, clearly felt debts of gratitude to their one-time keepers.
Though he had few words of praise for prisons staff generally, Grant Hervey thought
Manning was ‘a wise and entirely splendid type of prison official’.23 The wife of another
former Tuncurry inmate wondered whether OIC J. Templeton, Manning’s successor, had
plans to visit Sydney. If so, she asked ‘would you care to make our home your head-
quarters? You will find us very homely, so long as the babies do not worry you too
much!’24


Of the first generation of prison camp officers, four men particularly stand out: Charles
McArthur at Tuncurry and Emu Plains in NSW, James Quirk at the McLeod Settlement
in Victoria, Patrick Roche at St Helena in Queensland, and Carl Wilson at the Hayes
prison farm in Tasmania.25

him; see Report of the Comptroller-General of Prisons, New South Wales for the year 1918,

were well chosen. Grant Hervey claimed that a poor officer at Tuncurry made the entire camp
unproductive. Hervey, ‘Leg-Irons, the Lash, and the Gallows Tree’, The Daily Mail, 9 May 1922.
Another warder at Tuncurry was sacked in 1924, for telling ‘smutty stories’ to prisoners, amongst
other things. W. Urquhart to OIC J. F. Whitney, 17 June 1924, Prisons Department, Letters Sent,

Department of Prisons created a minor scandal by smuggling a large quantity of stolen cider to
inmates at Hayes Prison Farm. See Documents re theft of cider factory near Hayes Gaol Farm,

McArthur was the first OIC at Tuncurry, and the second at Emu Plains.26 CGP McCauley
described him as ‘an officer exceptionally qualified for the management of the young
prisoners and their work. He is possessed of great tact in dealing with officers and
prisoners, and would be very hard to replace’.27 There is no record any prisoner escaping
from either Tuncurry or Emu Plains when McArthur held charge. He punished sparingly,
and transferred only a handful of prisoners back to prison for disciplinary reasons.28 The
foresters who worked on the Tuncurry plantation during McArthur’s time there held him
in high esteem, and visitors to the farm came away deeply impressed too.29 In 1921, the
editor of The Southern Morning Herald, visited Emu Plains. Never having visited a
prison before, the editor expected to encounter ‘an irate officer of the law’, but instead
found McArthur to be:


         the practical farmer and the student of psychology; the man who could direct the
         tending of the unhealthy crop, and yet … was competent to train and guide the
         wayward spirit of erring youth. Here was a man born for the position he held.30


James Quirk was the superintendent of the McLeod Settlement from its creation in 1916
until 1924, and like McArthur was esteemed by colleagues and inmates. In 1921, the ISB
made special mention of way in which he carried out his duties. He had, they went on, all
the abilities necessary for the position, namely, ‘tact, sound judgement, and firmness with

kindness.’31 In January 1924, as he prepared to leave the island to take a promotion on the
mainland, twenty-eight prisoners with indeterminate sentences presented him with ‘an
address of appreciation’. They thanked him for his efforts to improve their conditions and
referred to him as their ‘personal friend’. One of Quirk’s charges said that until he came
to the island, he had felt that every hand in the world was raised against him. But the
treatment he received from Quirk and his officers, ‘took all the sting out of me’. Quirk
said he would have stayed indefinitely if it were not for his failing health.32

Patrick Roche, the superintendent at St Helena Prison Farm from 1926 to 1931, was
another impressive officer. A student of radical American penology, and a passionate
advocate of the honour system, he was one of a rare breed—both an idealist and a
competent officer. His daughter, Mary Bell, said her father had a firm belief that
environment was the cause of crime and if ‘given a go’ most prisoners would make good.
Many did, judging by the letters he received from them. ‘I thank you Mr Roche, and that
means more than words,’ one wrote correspondent. The grateful author of another
concluded: ‘A good many hungry days passed for me but still I fought, and the spirit of
Roche and St Helena were my greatest aids.’ One refused to believe that Roche had ‘a
single enemy in the world’ and assured him that ‘every man who has passed through your
hands knows fully well that you can never be replaced.’34 Several thanked their former
gaoler for personal loans of money he made to them on their release, and some
demonstrated their appreciation with gifts:


        I am sending you a little token of gratitude which I hope you will axcept & like
        … the cross opens & contains the relics I know you are a Roman Catholic by the
        lovely prayer book and sacred heart you gave Wally.35


Clive Wilson was probably the last of the exceptional first generation of officers-in-
charge. Wilson had charge of the Hayes Prison Farm from its creation until 1937 until his
retirement in 1949, apart from a brief stint of active military service during the war.36
Alfred Linton, the head of the Tasmanian Prison Service, thought him ‘a zealous and
enthusiastic officer who has the success of the Farm Gaol very much at heart.’ Wilson
himself described his duty as giving the thirty men at the farm ‘a more healthy and sane
idea of their duties and obligations as citizens’, and always emphasised the social value of
the farm over its productive capacities. His work, he said shortly before he was called up
in 1941, became ‘more interesting daily.’ With a dedication many of his successors
lacked, Wilson wrote in 1940 to Linton and Attorney General James McDonald: ‘May I

These officers’ achievements and attitudes were all the more remarkable given the
conditions they worked under. They were not well paid, and they received a great deal
less remuneration than governors of conventional prisons. They generally lived on site in
remote areas, and could not ‘clock off’ like their counterparts in the cities and towns.
They often worked ten or more days in a row. Like the prisoners, their accommodation
was rudimentary, especially in the early years. The quality of their food was variable.
They had to perform more hard manual labour than most officers, and were often exposed
to the elements. Although they were generally at less risk of physical assault from
prisoners than guards in closed prisons, they were at increased risk of other types of
mishap.38 At the same time, they had to manage heavy administrative workloads with
little or no clerical support, and maintain cordial relations with neighbours, who were
often hostile to the very presence of the camp. They also had to know at least a little of
agriculture and/or forestry.


Perhaps because of the difficulty of the posts, the camps were training grounds for future
senior administrators. Many of the early officers-in-charge, like O’Connor, Quirk, and D.
R. Jones, the second OIC at Pardelup, proved their competence in the camps and were
quickly promoted to senior ranks. O’Connor and Jones went on to become the
Superintendents of Boggo Road and Fremantle Prisons, respectively. Quirk became the
Governor of Ballarat Gaol, and Roche the Superintendent of Rockhampton Prison.39

in NSW, and ended it as Comptroller-General of Prisons in WA.40 Based on their
experiences, these officers pushed for extensions in the various prison camp systems, and
were agents of reform. Others like McArthur and Wilson, had little interest in personal
advancement, and devoted themselves to the institutions they helped to establish.




DISCIPLINE, SPACE, INTIMACY: A DIFFERENT KIND OF PRISON WORK


The preponderance of good officers at camp before the war provokes the question, why
were they to be found in such numbers at the camps and not across the prison systems
generally?41 The evidence suggests that the camps provided an opportunity for a new kind
of prison work. Many of the defining elements of work in conventional prisons—from
the style of discipline to the size of the prison population to be handled—were absent in
the camps, and staff keenly grasped the chance to do their jobs differently.


Before the war, the total number of prisoners at camp at any one time was generally not
more than fifty, and often less than thirty. J. F. Whitney, one of the architects of
Queensland prison farm system, thought it was essential to keep numbers low on each
farm. Better two farms with fifty prisoners each, he thought, than one with a hundred.42
Officers were required, moreover, to address prisoners by name, not by number as they
were in metropolitan prisons. This meant that officers at camp became much more
familiar with prisoners than their colleagues in the city could.


Familiarity was also encouraged at the camps by a different style of discipline. As
Thomas has observed, the middle years of the nineteenth century saw the start of
concerted efforts to professionalise many parts of public life. During this period, the

Seminar on the Punishment of Crime, NSW University of Technology, Sydney 1958, p. 2. In
1952, MacKillop was asked by the South Australian Comptroller, J. H. Allen for his advice in
establishing a new prison farm. MacKillop stressed that the choice of OIC was crucial: he would
need ‘an understanding of the frailties of human nature. Indeed, it can be said that the success of
any open institution, or any other institution, depends mainly on the officer charged with its
superintendence.’ MacKillop to Allen, 1 October 1952, Pardelup Prison Farm, Requests for

organisational structures of prisons services around the developed world were
transformed. In Australia and elsewhere, greater professionalism was sorely needed. The
use of prisoners to perform the work of paid staff was increasingly limited, standardised
staff salaries were introduced and the opportunities for staff to financially exploit
prisoners were reduced. Most importantly, prisons departments became para-military
organisations. Rank, uniform, promotion, and drill for officers were all modelled on the
armed services, and prisons services actively recruited discharged soldiers. Thomas
argues that this new organisational structure was designed ‘to deal with crises which arise
in a community, such as a prison, where there is absence of commonly agreed
assumptions about the laws which are established there’, adding that this change, along
with penitential architecture, was ‘the most persistent and controversial legacy’ of
nineteenth-century penology.43


At the prison camps, the para-militarism of the prisons services was toned down. Under
the honour system prisoners made agreements before transfer acknowledging that they
were, in a sense, their own keepers. In this context of agreed assumptions, para-militarism
was not only less necessary, but unhelpful. It ran against the fundamental principles of
the new system, and was out of place in the fields and among the trees. On occasion camp
guards were even reprimanded for being ‘too militaryfied’ in their manner.44 The regalia
of the prisons service was also muted at camp. Until the 1940s, officers at Queensland’s
prison farms wore civilian clothes, and were gazetted as Overseers (as in Tasmania),
rather than warders.45 So unconventional were the officers at Emu Plains, that a journalist
reported: ‘trust is the warder’.46


These differences created the opportunity for officers to relate to prisoners in new ways.47

   Frederick Domer was Principal Keeper at Sing Sing Prison in New York when Thomas Mott

exercise greater discretion and treat prisoners with greater respect. ‘Under the old system’, Domer

to get on my nerves … I wasn’t fit to live with. Now it is all different; I enjoy my work at the

Plains was a vital ingredient in the farm’s success.48 Informality was important too. ‘We
have a straight talk to start with, and after that neither of us wants to let the other down’,
Thomas Ryan, the OIC at Emu Plains said in 1937, explaining his style of management.49
Officers were even able to take on quasi-familial roles for some inmates. Many of the
first generation of officers-in-charge—men like McArthur and Wilson—were in the latter
stages of their careers, and much older than the prisoners in their charge. The Catholic
Chaplain to Emu Plains Prison Farm described ‘the discipline and kind fatherly advice of
Mr. McArthur’ as the key to the farm’s success. Another observer described McArthur a
‘big-hearted father’ to the young inmates at Emu Plains.50 The NSW Prisons Department
was certainly keen to reinforce this image:

Other officers could play fraternal roles. One inmate who served at the McLeod
Settlement during Quirk’s time, wrote gratefully of ‘the brotherly spirit of the officers’ on
the island.52 Roche was clearly able to play both roles; one of his former charges later told
him that ‘you were our elder brother’ and that ‘we have all looked upon you as a father’.53
Effectively taking the role of a brother or father-figure did not mean active friendship or
excessive sympathy, which were counter-productive if taken too far.54 It should be noted
that paternalism was not unknown in closed prisons. Joseph Berkovits has said that early
twentieth-century prisons ‘were places where personal interactions mattered, where
maternalism and paternalism and other familial relations did bring a measure of order to
the chaos.’55 Within prison walls though, there was a limit to how far familial modes of
interaction could be pushed. At camp these limits were greatly extended.56


The absence of conventional penal architecture was at least as significant for staff as the
absence of conventional penal discipline. If prison camps created a space where prisoners
could express their better qualities, it is not surprising that the camps had a positive effect
on guards too.57 Guards in closed prisons have often claimed that they too served time,
albeit in blocks of eight to ten hours. Senior administrators, observers and prisoners
agreed that prolonged periods in prisons had powerfully negative effects on staff. Vance
Marshall, an inmate at Goulburn Prison shortly after the First World War, thought
penitential architecture called out the worst in his guards, whose duty was ‘simply to use
the awful power conferred … by walls of stone and bars of iron to terrorise, tyrannise,
and oppress [their] crushed, spirit-broken, helpless fellow men.’58


Marshall was fond of such vigorous prose, but the apparatus of security in conventional
prisons embodied distrust, and without doubt, had an effect on officers.59 In 1938,

Victorian Inspector-General Joseph Akeroyd said that guards in closed prisons were
‘more guardians and supervisors than leaders’. They tended ‘to become restricted in
outlook and suspicious of all men’.60 He later added that the captive population in closed
prisons was ‘so lawless and so apt to take advantage of any leniency that officers are apt
to be dominated by the security view-point and so lose sight of the final aim—education
in citizenship.’61


At a conference of Australasian prison administrators in 1966, W. M. English, the
Controller of Corrective Institutions for Papua and New Guinea described the effects of
prison work in closed prisons on his junior custodial staff. His remarkably candid account
accords with Akeroyd’s view, and is worth quoting at length:


         The fierce, but silent warfare between the prison community on the one hand,
         striving to preserve its subculture of hate, hostility, distrust, and inverted status,
         as well as its ceaseless contriving to gain privileges and amenities as well as
         exploit staff weaknesses; and on the other hand, the officer ambivalently trying to
         impose control, maintain security and subscribe to a programme of treatment,
         must create tensions and uncertainties too great for the young officer to bear with
         equanimity. A quick resignation, token service, refuge in a cloak of strict and
         rigid discipline, or a splenetic detestation of all prisoners are frequently observed
         reactions … The concentrated and generalised nature of prison hatred bewilders
         the officer … In reality, the captor becomes the captive; captured by the primitive
         feelings and emotions of those he despises. In varying degrees, the officer
         becomes aware of his state, and he projects his revulsion of the ugly picture of
         himself by hatred of prisoners.62

Akeroyd felt that conditions at camp called for a different brand of officer. They had ‘a
much more difficult task and must be men of outstanding ability and really good training.
They should be leaders and teachers rather than supervisors and guardians.’63


Life in the early gaols, such as Newgate, had revolved around the keepers. Their power
was nearly absolute and they ran their gaols in their own interest. The penitential
architecture that developed from the late eighteenth century was self-consciously
designed to limit the autonomy and the capricious, unbridled power of the keepers, as
well as preventing unwanted association between prisoners. According to Robin Evans,
late-eighteenth-century reformers such as John Howard passionately believed in


         investing power in places rather than persons. They believed that by removing a
         large portion of the authority concentrated till then in the unreliable hands of
         gaolers, and redistributing it throughout the inert and seemingly passive body of
         the prison building, they would be able to reduce the violence of authority and
         increase its scope at one and the same time.64


The rise of penitential architecture marked an important turning point in the history of
guard-prisoner interaction. From this time, the history of prison design became ‘the
history of the removal of power from those who worked and lived within to those who
ruled the prison from outside’.65


It is not surprising that guards felt they had an enlarged role to play beyond the walls of
the penitentiary. At camp, power was again invested in people, rather than structures, and
whatever power officers wielded, it did not come from buildings.66 In this way, the work
of guards at camp was akin to that of the old keepers. Modern officers at camp were of
course salaried professionals, unlike the old keepers. Nor did they have the same absolute

   It could be argued that as camp guards could have a prisoner transferred back to a closed prison,
architecture was an indirect source of authority, but on a day-to-day level the difference is quite
clear.

control, motives or reputation, but their character and agency were similarly central to the
daily operation of the prison.


At the same time, the camps offer glimpses into the future of prison work. In camp,
guards had to perform many of the functions ceded to architecture in conventional
prisons. Without the ‘awful power’ of walls and bars, staff were forced to rely on
interpersonal skills in their work with inmates to a new degree. As it was impossible to
maintain discipline in camp through a rigid application of the regulations, the boundaries
of authority had to be negotiated on a daily basis, an experience officers in closed prisons
did not fully confront until the 1970s.67 Prisoners’ huts were not locked at most camps,
not even at night. Some camps had dormitories for prisoners, making it impossible to
separate the prison population. There were no punishment cells in which troublemakers
might be isolated, nor watch towers to afford safe and commanding views of inmates.
When unrest spread throughout a camp, it could not be ‘locked down’ in the way a
conventional prison could. Without the discrete wings of a penitentiary, if a riot erupted
at camp there was little to prevent it from engulfing the entire prison. And with no walls
to scale, the only way a guard could prevent escape was to convince prisoners that it was
in their interest to stay. These skills were not unique to prison camp guards; guards at
prisons of all types relied on more than force to maintain order and good behaviour. But
in the absence of total architecture, the character and interpersonal skills of guards were
tested in uncommon ways.


The experience of the first generation of camp officers confirms what many guards and
sensitive administrators have long known—that success or failure of a prison system
hinges upon the quality of its staff to a much greater extent than the sophistication of its
buildings. Alexander Paterson, the originator of the Borstal system in England, expressed
this point eloquently when he said:


        It is men and not buildings who will change the hearts and ways of misguided
        lads. Better an institution that consists of two log-huts in swamp or desert, with a
        staff devoted to their task, than a model block of buildings, equipped without
        thought of economy, whose staff is solely concerned with thoughts of pay and
        promotion.68

   As prison regimes were relaxed in the 1970s, guards in closed prisons were forced to interact
with prisoners in new ways. See Lynn and Armstrong, From Pentonville to Pentridge, p. 292.

THE EFFECT OF POOR STAFF: THE CASE OF STONE RIVER STATE FARM


If prison camps created spaces where good staff could thrive in their roles, they also
enabled substandard staff to cause drastic problems. Inadequate staff could create
difficulties for any institution, especially those as small and isolated as prison farms. One
incompetent or malcontent officer at a camp could undermine the whole operation. The
story of Stone River prison farm in the years 1949 to 1956 is worth exploring in some
detail as it shows just how dysfunctional a prison camp could become with poor staff. It
also highlights the unanticipated implications that prison camps, as a reform, had for
Australian prison staff after the war.


Stone River State Farm was founded in 1945, near Ingham in North Queensland. The first
three officers-in-charge were capable enough. The founding OIC, Allan Whitney was ‘a

red barn.’ Quoted in William Nagel, The new red barn; a critical look at the modern American
prison, (New York: Walker 1973), p. 1.

fine style of a man’ according to Tom King.70 The second, warder W. G., found the work
particularly stimulating. ‘I experience great pride in the part I play in the Honour system
of rehabilitating prisoners,’ he wrote, adding: ‘I think of the farm as my own’.71 The third
OIC, warder L. T., also seems to have been competent, and well-regarded by both head
office and local settlers. Under these officers, the prisoners were industrious and appeared
to be content, according to Deputy CGP Kerr. By 1949 there were three single officers
employed at the farm, but Kerr thought that the isolation of the farm warranted the
posting of an extra, married officer as the OIC.72 The officer selected was J. M., and
things took a dramatic turn after his arrival.


M. was cruel and mistrustful. Several prisoners at Stone River complained about their
treatment at his hands. When they were sick or injured, he would give them an aspirin
and tell them to ‘sleep on it’, no matter how acute the injury or illness was. He withheld
much-needed clothing, forced prisoners to use substandard tools, and blamed the inmates
when the equipment was damaged in accidents. On at least one occasion he issued a
prisoner with two boots of different sizes. Prisoner A. T. said that M. repeatedly denied
his request for a transfer to Townsville to have a troublesome tooth removed, and forced
him to perform heavy manual labour with a badly injured wrist.73


M. was also verbally abusive. One prisoner, F. A., said that M. would ‘sneak up through
the cane and timber’ on the men as they were grubbing, and surprise them by loudly
berating them. F. A. also remembered being told by M. on more than one occasion that
‘no crim was worth feeding’. In front of other prisoners, M. would refer to information he
had learned about A.’s wife, from the letters she sent to her imprisoned husband. M. had
a crippling effect on prisoner morale.74 One prisoner said, tactfully, that he believed that
the ‘with the right man in charge’ the farm would be ‘an ideal institution for the

rehabilitation of prisoners.’75 Another put it more directly: ‘The farm is a lot better than
the jail, but definitely not under [M.]. He doesn’t understand men.’76


The prisoners were not alone in their antipathy for M.; he often clashed with his
subordinate officers too. In September 1954, warder R. B. wrote to CGP Samuel Kerr
with a number of complaints. He had been castigated by M. when he had questioned his
superior officer about farm operations. He also felt patronized by M.’s wife—M. would
leave the farm’s keys with her rather than the warders when he was called away from the
farm, and B. resented having to ask for the keys from an individual not employed by the
department. He suspected, moreover, that Mrs M. shared her husband’s low opinion of
the farm’s junior staff. B. said he had been in the practice of ‘giving a helping hand with
the work to be done’ by the men under his charge. He found this made them more ‘co-
operative in their efforts’, and felt it helped ‘indirectly in their rehabilitation’. M. had
instructed him otherwise, saying the practice made him ‘too familiar’ with the inmates. B.
asked M. if rehabilitation was the farm’s official objective, but M. replied: ‘Originally
that was the idea, but it is out of bounds now.’77 Perplexed, B. wrote to Kerr:


        I have no idea what he means by this … apparently I have been under a
        misapprehension of my actual duties here, but in future I will refrain from
        working alongside with the prisoners unless notified to the contrary by the
        Controller General on this matter.78


B. left the farm not long after, but, M.’s poor relations with his staff continued, and the
ranking officer’s fallout with warder P. K. had unfortunate consequences not only for the
inmates at the farm, but for the Queensland prison service generally. The precise source
of this conflict is not entirely clear, but within months of K.’s arrival, the two officers
were arguing in front of the prisoners and openly insulting each other. Prisoner J. H.
claimed that K.’s behaviour changed very noticeably after the conflict began.79 K. had
previously got on well with the prisoners and assisted them in their labour, but stopped at
M.’s command. As the conflict between him and M., worsened, so too did K.’s treatment
of prisoners. One inmate reported K. came to take ‘a sadistic delight’ in making life hard

for them.80 He deducted remission for petty misdemeanours, and forced the inmates to
drink their water from rust-encrusted billies.81 He reprimanded them for straightening
their backs or wiping their brows, and when they made mistakes, he talked to them ‘like a
man would talk to a dog’.82 Like M., he would refuse medical treatment for sick or hurt
prisoners.


One prisoner later recalled that he ‘fell out of friendship’ with P. K. as he changed.83
Others felt more strongly. One of a number of prisoners who escaped from the farm in
1955, gave as his reason for doing so: ‘I was afraid that, had I stayed, I should have killed
[K.]’.84 Significantly, this was not full-blooded escape; the prisoners involved intended to
be recaptured. Some of them had asked, repeatedly and without success, to be transferred
back to Townsville. They knew that they would not be returned to the farm after the
escape, and they hoped to improve conditions for the remaining inmates by drawing
attention to the problems at the farm.85 Comptroller Rutherford described this escape as
the worst incident in a ‘black period’ for the Queensland Prisons Service.86


Shortly before the escape, P. K.’s relationship with J. M. was at a low ebb, and his
demeanour changed a second time. He stopped abusing the prisoners, and seemed not to
care whether they worked or not.87 Prisoner V. S. recalled K. promising that ‘he would be
a better man than he had been.’ K. encouraged the malcontent prisoners to escape, and
even offered them the use of his car for the purpose.88 The prisoners obliged, and when
K.’s role in the incident was discovered, he was dismissed.89


P. K.’s role in the escape was so blatant that he must have known it would be discovered,
and that he would lose his job as a result. Perhaps, like the escapees, he could stomach
life at the farm no longer, and wished to humiliate J. M. as he went. Perhaps he had
become disgusted at himself, at what he had become at the farm. It seems likely that there
is some connection between his re-found gentleness and his decision to assist with the
escape. Knowing that his frustrations with M. would soon be over, perhaps he no longer

felt the need to take them out on the prisoners.90 Among all these possibilities, a few
things are certain. Under a bully or even just an individual poorly suited for charge of the
camp, life was miserable for prisoners and junior officers alike, possibly to a greater
degree than in closed prisons. Staff were able to vent their frustration on the prisoners,
but for the prisoners, the only option was escape.91


The troubles at Stone River did not cease with P. K.’s departure. The isolation of the
farm, the lack of accommodation for the families of married officers, the lack of nearby
amenities, and J. M.’s reputation made it very difficult to staff the farm at all. Turnover
was high, and replacements almost impossible to find. In 1956, as he dispatched two new
warders to Stone River, Comptroller Rutherford enjoined J. M. to ‘excuse any
shortcoming they may have, through inexperience, and rally round and assist them in
every possible way’. These two men were, Rutherford added, the only two men in the
service who ‘were prepared to come to Stone River, and I’m sure that you will also show
your appreciation’.92




POST-WAR STAFFING PROBLEMS


According to the standing orders for penal officers at the McLeod Settlement, published
in 1967: ‘A man is not a success as a Prison Officer if he has the misfortune or
unwillingness not to grasp the significance of his position.’93 Unfortunately, after the
Second World War, officers at prison camps seemed to be increasingly unaware of the
significance of their positions. J. M. and P. K. represented an admittedly extreme example
of dysfunctional staffing, but they were symptomatic of a general pattern.94




90
   It is not known what happened to P. K. after he was dismissed. J. M. was shifted to Numinbah
prison farm, but took long service leave in 1960, suffering from anxiety and depression. When he
returned, he took a voluntary demotion and was posted to Wacol Prison in Brisbane. ‘Annual
Report of the Comptroller-General of Prisons for the year ended 30th June, 1960’, JOL, p. 5.
91
   The inmate testimony regarding these incidents is overwhelmingly consistent, but does not
appear to be orchestrated. The possibility that the various statements were concertedly dishonest
seems implausible.

   In the early 1940s, staffing at the Pardelup Prison Farm became so unsatisfactory that the
complete staff had to be replaced. A. Dickson to F. E. Huelin, 23 September 1941, Pardelup Prison
Farm, Progress reports on operations, 1932-52, Chief Secretary’s Files, SROWA WAS 675, Con

                                              295

The calibre of the staff at camps across the country declined appreciably in this period.
Even as staff training and education programs became progressively more elaborate,
turnover increased, and scandals involving misconduct by officers became more
frequent.95 Unlike the earlier period, there is little evidence of camp staff committing
themselves to camps for long periods, or of former camp officials rising to the top ranks
of the service.


This decline can be linked with changes in the nature of prison work in this period. As we
have seen, the camps themselves were not the institutions they had been before the war.
The size and composition of their prisoner populations changed significantly.96 As
prisoner numbers rose in the 1950s and 1960s, camps caught the overflow from the
metropolitan gaols. New camps were established, but not enough to maintain the old pre-
war populations, and by the mid-1960s many camps which had held approximately thirty
prisoners before the war, had musters of over a hundred each. Staff numbers were not
always increased, and officers-in-charge could no longer be expected to have a detailed
knowledge of each prisoner. With larger musters, officers were forced to apply para-
military discipline at camps too, and the dynamics of familiarity changed. In 1959, the
Tasmanian Controller of Prisons W. Lonergan asked the Public Service Commissioner to
increase the staff quota at the Hayes Prison Farm, ‘as a matter or urgency’. The quota had
remained the same as the inmate muster increased by fifty per cent, and consequently the
OIC ‘has far too much to do at present and … cannot give sufficient time to the things
that need his attention the most.’97 The intense bonds between prisoners and officers such
as Quirk or Roche had been formed in small prison communities; the larger the camp, the
more difficult it must have become to forge such relationships.


The increasing regulation of officers’ work may have also been significant. When Alan
Paton took control of the Diepkloof Reformatory in South Africa, there were almost no
regulations governing how he ran the institution, giving him he said ‘a freedom to
experiment such as comes to few of us in our lifetimes’. He thought this freedom

essential to the remarkable results of his work at the reformatory.98 Likewise in Australia
in the early years of the prison camps, officers-in-charge were bound only lightly by
regulation, and perhaps they too appreciated this fact.




Remuneration and isolation


Prison work has never been lucrative. Even before the Second World War, rates of pay
were low.99 After the war, rates became increasingly less attractive, relative to other
careers. This was a period of full employment and workers could earn substantially more
in several walks of life. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the pay scale for warders in
Queensland was £10/5/0, little more than the minimum wage. Many capable officers left
the service, often up to six per month from each prison.100 Roy Stephenson was one
officer who found the stress of prison life too much, and its rewards too meagre to bear.
He resigned from the service in 1946 to pursue a much more profitable occupation as a
taxi driver.101 In 1957 the Victorian Social Welfare Department, which had control of the
state’s prisons, advertised the position of Superintendent of the Langi Kal Kal Training
Centre, a new prison camp for young offenders. The successful candidate was to possess:


        a sound education, with preferably a University Degree in Arts, Education, Law
        or Commerce. Some evidence of study and research in the problems of
        delinquency and psychology. A strong personality, with resourcefulness and

emergencies, Stephenson was recalled to help out, even though he was not officially an employee.
On one occasion, his taxi was commandeered to search for two dangerous escapees. He eventually
returned to the service, but this decision had little to do with money.

         patience in the handling of impetuous youths. Experience in institutional
         management.102


For such an individual, the department offered the minimum award wage. Perhaps, not
surprisingly, the position was advertised several times before an acceptable applicant was
found, and even then only after the italicised words were removed.103


As prison staff went backwards financially, compared to the rest of the workforce,
professional expectations of officers were rising. According to the 1956 NSW ‘Manual
for Staff Instruction and Guidance’, for instance, the officer


         should render, with promptitude and cheerfulness, the same implicit obedience
         that he is required to exact … An officer should keep in view the objective of
         rehabilitating prisoners and strive to acquire a moral influence by the standards of
         his own conduct … An officer should at all times guard his tongue against lewd,
         blasphemous or indecent language, scurrility or falsehood …While officers are
         required to adopt a humane and friendly attitude towards prisoners, they must
         remain aloof from them and in no circumstances have dealing with them or their
         relatives.104


Increasingly elaborate training and education programs were developed.105 For those on
such poor wages, talk of grand duties and penological theories must have sounded at least

     Even those who developed such training programs could be sceptical about them. John
Morony, for instance, who literally wrote the book on the subject, thought training was of limited
use; the qualities most required in an officer were he said ‘the sort of things that come best from a
good man, an honest man, a tactful man, a sensible man, a good living man’. Morony The Issues
Raised’, in The Conflict of Security and Rehabilitation: A Seminar on the Punishment of Crime,

a little hollow.106 In Victoria, from 1958, new staff members were mostly trained off the
job, at a new officer-education facility in Hawthorn, which quickly came to be known
among the uniformed staff as ‘Bullshit Castle’.107


It is no surprise that isolated prisons were particularly affected by the staffing crisis.
Queensland Comptroller William Rutherford found recruiting for his prisons, particularly
those in the north like Stone River, ‘a matter of grave concern’. In 1951 he said:


        the shortage of staff is chiefly due to the small salaries paid to warders at the
        commencement of their service. Even warders of longer service are leaving to
        take more lucrative positions elsewhere. Two good officers went to the Police
        Force and two to the RAAF to receive much better salaries.108


The Cadell Prison Farm, on the Murray River, had been open only a matter of months
when it was reported, in early 1961, that warders in Adelaide were ready to resign if
transferred to country posts, including Cadell. Indeed several staff had already resigned
from Cadell, citing the high cost of living in the area, and the isolation.109

    Richard Broome, Coburg: Between Two Creeks, Coburg Historical Society, Melbourne, 2001,
p. 286. The scepticism of staff when it came to penological theory, was clearly expressed in the
various prisons officers’ magazines. ‘The Prison Officers’ Prayer’ by ‘Lealco’, (The Grapevine,
vol. 3, March 1964, p. 9) is a good example:

        Our work which art in Pentridge, Penology be its name,
        Thy chosen vocation, Thy duty will be done, as it is in
        the regulations. Give us each our weekly pay; And
        forgive us our late relieving, As we forgive them that
        are late relieving us, And let us know who is on the station,
        To save us from evil. For such is the custom,
        both morning, and in the afternoon; First Watch and Second
        Watch:

On at least one occasion, it appears that the isolation of a camp was used by the
department against a subordinate officer. In 1968, Robert Bennetts, an officer at
Pentridge Prison in Melbourne, broke prison regulations by failing to fire on escaping
prisoners, and was subsequently disciplined by the prisons department. An inquiry by the
State Public Service Board exonerated him, but the department transferred him to French
Island, in an attempt—according to Bennetts’ union—to force him to retire. Bennetts said
he was unwilling to accept the transfer because his wife was in poor health, but found
himself unable to appeal the decision.110




Amenity and family


One of the problems associated with the isolation of the camps was their lack of amenity.
This problem contributed to the conflict between staff at Stone River. One of the matters
warder R. B. complained of in 1954 was OIC J. M.’s attitude to the social life of his
subordinates. Permission had been granted to warders at Stone River to visit the nearest
hotel by the Deputy CGP, Samuel Kerr, on the condition that they did not become
intoxicated and left before closing time. However, M. was a teetotaller, and disapproved
of his staff drinking. One day in September, B. told M. that he was going to the hotel. M.
warned B. that if he went there too often he would have to report him to head office, and
expressed his dissatisfaction with the Deputy CGP’s decision. If he had his way, all the
officers on the farm would be teetotallers. B. protested; given ‘the position of the farm
and lack of amenities I don’t think it unreasonable to journey to the hotel on odd
occasions’, he said, adding that he had never ‘shown other than sober habits’ during his
time in the service.111


The question of whether or not an officer could easily visit a hotel may appear to be a
trivial one, but it is not. Thomas wrote of the ‘sheer intrinsic stress’ of prison work.112
When Warder E. T. retired in 1970 after 29 years working at Hayes Prison Farm, he was
asked if would pursue the same career again, given the choice. ‘Not on your life,’ he
replied. ‘There’s too much worry in it.’113 Senior administrators gradually came to
recognise the importance of officers’ access to a life beyond the prison, and away from its

stresses. Not long after R. B.’s departure, Rutherford put the difficulties staffing Stone
River down ‘principally to the fact that the Farm offers so few amenities’.114 His
Victorian counterpart, Joseph Akeroyd, thought that:


         persons employed within a prison are apt to deteriorate in character and to take
         something of the color of their surroundings unless near their homes they have
         ample opportunity to get away from the prison atmosphere and associate with
         men and women who know nothing of prison life.115


Unmarried officers were almost impossible to attract to the camps. Married officers were
less reluctant, but they were ‘disinclined to be separated from their families’, as
Akeroyd’s successor, Alexander Whatmore noted. ‘A solution to this may be found in the
erection of cottages on the unit farms’.116 Accordingly, family accommodation was
erected at camps in most states, including the Cadell Prison Farm, the Palen Creek Prison
Farm and the Pardelup Prison Farm.117 In this regard, it is worth noting that several of the
first generation of officers-in-charge remained bachelors, or only married late in life;
Patrick Roche, for one, did not marry until he was almost sixty.118


Family accommodation enabled the department to fill vacant positions, but isolation was
at least as much a problem for officers’ families as it was for the officers themselves.
When the Stone River prison farm was de-proclaimed in 1962, CGP Kerr pointed out the
problems the farm’s location had posed for officers’ families. It was five miles to the
nearest school ‘through wild and snake-infested country’ and the farm was too remote

But according to Roy Stephenson, before the war, ‘such was the type of man in the service … with
few exceptions, they had that ingrained sense of responsibility and dedication to the job which
made each man perform his duty when the going got rough.’ (See Nor Iron Bars, p. 25).

fellow penal administrators that officers ‘should be encouraged to develop social contact with
groups of people who know nothing of prisons and prisoners, in order to counter the pernicious
effect of constant exposure to the criminal population. He should also be made aware of the danger
of poisoning of his moral system to which his occupation exposes him.’ See ‘The Effect of Prison

and too small to justify a medical officer of its own.119 Ten years earlier, the Kyeema
Prison Camp in South Australia had been closed for similar reasons.120 Isolation was also
central to the decision, in 1975, to close the McLeod Prison Farm.121


Not all the camps were so isolated, and many of the most successful camps were
those—like the Emu Plains and Hayes prison farms—that were located close to urban
centres. Even where reasonable amenities were available to officers and their families
though, the presence of families on-site created a new set of problems, particularly at
those camps at which there were inmates convicted of serious crimes against children.
Most states held sex offenders at their camps, despite early assurances from politicians
that they would not. This was particularly true in Tasmania and Queensland, and
especially after the Second World War. Sex offenders were often docile, productive
workers, and if their offences involved children, homosexuality or incest, then they were
often at risk of assault from other prisoners in conventional prisons. The lower rates of
violence at camp, and sex offenders’ good behaviour in prison made their removal to
camp an attractive option for administrators. Custodial officers at camp saw the matter
differently, however.


Where guards’ families lived on site, the presence of prisoners convicted of serious
crimes against women or children caused unrest. In January 1971 three officers with
families at Numinbah State Farm in Queensland complained, first to their superintendent
and then to the CGP, about the arrival of W. W., who had been convicted of raping a ten
year old child. Officers N. K., G. G., and L. M. requested that W. W. be returned to a
closed prison. ‘We have never felt so strongly before, but as the victim was a child we
feel we would never forgive ourselves if we let this matter go without telling you of our
concern’, they said.122 Shortly afterwards, W. W. was moved to a different prison.123

    CGP J. H. Allen stated the camp closed ‘because of the difficulty in obtaining and retaining
suitable staff’, and added ‘it has not been considered advisable to erect houses for married staff
and, because of the isolated position of the camp, it is difficult to secure enthusiastic officers.’

    Victoria’s prison population was falling at the time the decision was made, but no sooner had
McLeod closed than the state’s prison population began to rise again, precipitously. The
department briefly considered re-opening the camp, but decided against it.

Families lived on-site at Palen Creek State Farm too, and some years earlier, a sex
offender had given officers cause for alarm. In 1958, E. W, a prisoner convicted of incest
was transferred from the farm to the Brisbane Mental Hospital in Goodna. While at the
hospital, E. W. wrote a letter to the young daughter of Overseer W. E., the only girl on
the farm. It was a strange note. Written with polite warmth, E. W. told her the location of
some misplaced tools, and then asked: ‘How are Mum and Dad and the other Warders …
I often think of you.’ With the help of the doctor at Goodna, E. W. said he planned to go
straight back from here to Palen Creek. ‘I am not an underworld man, so you need never
worry about me being mixed up in any shady work.’124 In response to the warder’s
concerns, E. W. was not returned to Palen Creek and was prevented from writing to the
girl again.


The available records furnish only one example of a member of an officer’s family
coming to harm at the hands of an inmate at a camp anywhere in the country.125
Nevertheless, officers naturally bristled with worry wherever their families lived
alongside sex offenders and in terms of staffing the camps, this anxiety was the real
problem.126


All these issues made staffing the camps difficult, and in a vicious cycle, staff shortages
in turn produced new problems. In the mid-1970s, the last Governor of the McLeod
Prison Farm, expressed his frustration at this fact: ‘shortage of staff meant overtime and
excessive overtime has dulled the keenness of the officers and reduced their
effectiveness’.127 According to the penological theory on which they were supposedly
based, the camps were a response to criminality rather than crime. They were to be places
where the individual prisoner’s needs could be recognised and responded to. Their
planners never considered the implications they would have for staff—yet as a reform,
the camps had very real effects on the lives of officers and their families. These effects in
turn bore on the workings of the camps.

Before the war a handful of remarkable individuals were willing to accept the drawbacks
of isolation and scant remuneration. But by the 1950s, things had changed. There were
more camps, with more prisoners, requiring more staff. The new guards were less
committed to the idealism than their predecessors, and the labour market did not
encourage dedication to the service. For officers and their families, there were better
opportunities in the cities than there were at the camps, or in the small townships nearby.
Good staff left, and bad staff set about zealously defending their meagre pay and
conditions. Across the prison systems, officers had less faith in the ideals of the service,
and in the end, officers at camp and at head office simply saw less reason to care.128




THE CASE OF FRANK POSSELT


While staff quality decreased after the war, there were still a few officers capable of
inspiring prisoners as James Quirk or Patrick Roche had done. Frank Posselt was one of
these.


Posselt was admittedly not a member of custodial staff; he was the education officer at
McLeod Prison Farm (formerly the McLeod Settlement) from 1955 to 1957.129 Only
twenty-four years old when arrived on the island, he was an unconventional prison
officer. He criticised the penal system, and the general public’s attitudes towards it, and
encouraged prisoners to find constructive ways to do the same.130 Several prisoners
became intensely attached to Posselt during his short stint on the island. According to
prisoner J. L., Posselt


         went beyond the dictates of duty to make life a little bit brighter for the men of
         this camp … He has never turned a man down when that man needed help … He
         has painstakingly listened to our tales of woe, our fears, our hopes.


         Mr Posselt has indeed been the Father Confessor to the men of this camp … I am
         handicapped by lack of words in my desire to describe what Mr Posselt means to
         the men of this Prison … He had no favourites. All men were the same to him …

128
    Very similar difficulties spelt the end of the North Sea Camp, a British borstal. According to
Tyndale it was ‘a bold experiment in penal reform’, but it could not be sustained because ‘it failed
to take into account the needs of the staff’. Tyndale, Prison People, pp. 22-23.
129
    Posselt was the island’s second education officer. The first was David Biles, who went on to
become one of Australia’s leading criminologists.

        we give you the grateful thanks of the men who live in this artificial nether-world
        … you may leave us, but you will never be forgotten. I thank you on behalf of the
        men of McLeod.131


To another prisoner at McLeod, Posselt was ‘the Robinson Crusoe of French Island … to
all his Man Fridays, who go like him shipwrecked sailors from the sea of life,
castaways.’132 In this prisoner, and certainly others, Posselt had managed to ignite not
only a genuine interest in a changed life, but a passionate concern for his fellow prisoners
and society generally. Prison officials, the prisoner complained, were judged not by how
many prisoners they assist, but by how many they prevent from escaping. In this context,
Posselt was:


        one of a band of Crusaders, fighting through the Slough of medieval ideas,
        centuries old superstition and prejudice, against the satisfying of the primitive
        instinct for revenge, rather than attacking the problem of crime. These things
        must be done scientifically not emotionally … This small band of Crusaders is
        fighting the tribal magic-word-power of superstitions, dressed up in twentieth
        century clothes … As Mr Posselt would say: ‘How about it, Mr Citizen? … Bon
        Voyage, modern Robinson Crusoe!! and THANKS!!133


Posselt’s work at McLeod is proof that even as work at the camps became less and less
attractive, there were still exceptional individuals who saw reasons to care about the
work. His departure from the service, after only two years, also demonstrates what was
lost when such individuals moved on.




CONCLUSION


In the early 1930s, the American penologist John Gillin visited Witzwil, a model prison
farm in Switzerland. He came away impressed with what he had seen. But what struck
him most was the Superintendent. ‘If ever you will see it on earth,’ he wrote afterwards,

‘here you will see the realization of Emerson’s famous aphorism that ‘an institution is but
the lengthened shadow of a man.’134


The first generation of officers at the Australian prison camps cast long shadows indeed,
but their contributions have gone unrecognised. Much has rightly been written in attempts
to humanise the prisoner, but the same sympathy and imagination should be extended to
those who worked in prisons, not merely those in head offices, but the many unsung
workers who dealt with prisoners, face-to-face, every day.


Guards have often been described as obstacles to reform. It is certainly true that when
they perceive penal reform to be at odds with their industrial interests, they have
stubbornly and effectively resisted change, as they still do. But officers can be vectors for
change too. The history of the prison camps demonstrates the vital role of the guard in
prison reform. The systems’ early successes and their later disappointments can be
connected with the quality of the keepers. Before the war, there were relatively few
camps, and the ideals they embodied remained fresh. The number of officers required to
run the camps was reasonably small, many of them felt personally invested in the success
or failure of the camps, and they served under comptrollers deeply interested in the
operations of their institutions. The labour market, and its culture, encouraged new roles
for camp officers, and dedication. Many of these officers rose to senior ranks, and pushed
for the expansion of the camp systems. Indeed, the camps’ fortunes turned more on these
individuals than they did on the system of penology, the regime of labour, or the style of
architecture. As the leading early twentieth-century American penologist, Sanford Bates
put it: ‘in the hands of an intelligent, big-hearted, persevering official, any system will be
successful’.135


In the second half of the century, pressures caused by the location of the camps and the
rising numbers of prisoners they held, and by the pay scale of the work, gave rise to
serious staffing difficulties. While the services tried to address specific issues as they
emerged, such as family accommodation, they did not go to the core of the matter, and

indeed only created new dilemmas. The prison camp movement foundered at least in part
not on ill-conceived penological principles, but on problems with personnel.

                              Prisons, History, Policy



The history of the Australian prison camps does not offer a model for understanding
penal change in general terms. To explain the camps as a reform requires the analysis of a
complex and particular set of variables: the economics and politics of prison labour, the
responses to the challenges presented by a generation of prison buildings and the
penological principles they embodied, and the ways in which an imagined penal past and
future affect reform discourse. Not all these variables would be significant in the history
of other reform projects, or not to the same extent. Other reforms would call forth
different, equally complex factors. As Michael Ignatieff argued, the ‘real challenge’ is to
find:


          a model of historical explanation which accounts for institutional change without
          imputing conspiratorial rationality to a ruling class, without reducing institutional
          development to a formless ad hoc adjustment to a contingent crisis, and without
          assuming a hyper-idealist, all-triumphant humanitarian crusade.1


History cannot offer a universal model for understanding how penal systems have
changed, but historical research can help frame important issues of policy in the present.
To date, however, those charged with formulating penal or correctional policy have been
little interested in history, except as an ornament or a morality tale. As Séan McConville
writes:


          penal history, where it has been studied at all, has been a source of self-
          congratulation rather than of warnings…neither reformers nor administrators
          consider it worth while seriously to ponder the experience of earlier generations.2

                                                308

This reflects the fact that penal discourse makes a fetish of innovation. The past has been
demonised to the point that it has become impossible to characterise a proposed change as
a ‘return’ to a previous practice, no matter how sound. This is particularly true in
Australia, where the ghosts of the convict system still have the power to spook.3 In penal
discourse this seems at times almost like a closed loop: reforms are successful because
they are new, and because they are new, they must be successful. This is an effective way
to bolster support for one’s own program of reform—to depict one’s predecessors’
policies not simply as failures, but as the product of entirely different and wrong-headed
philosophies. The errors of the past are quarantined, while the policies of the present are
sure to succeed, by virtue of a more virtuous philosophy. Consequently, our capacity to
think constructively about penal reform is diminished.


As a reform, the prison camps reflect this difficulty. To be comprehensible as a penal
reform, the camps had to be floated on the rhetoric of modernity, but they were in many
senses a step back, to an earlier penology, to the transportation-era convict system, to the
garden. And for all their problems, they were humane places. Some of the principles on
which they were based might be worth revisiting. Coming to terms with the fact that
earlier generations have pursued the same tasks as ourselves, in the same spirit, albeit
with different methods and language, makes the task of reform much more challenging,
but it also broadens our options: the wheel does not have to be reinvented.4


The history of the camps also offers more particular insights. It suggests, for instance,
that for many prisoners, walls and bars are unnecessary cruelties. Escapes moreover
probably do not need to provoke as much anxiety as they do. Driven by local unease and
sensational newspaper coverage, penal bureaucrats sought to reduce the number of
escapes from camp and emphasise their infrequency, but they may have been better

  At an international corrections conference held in Sydney in 1988, John Dawes, the Executive
Director of the South Australian Department of Corrective Services said that the bicentenary, as
the anniversary of a historic penal experiment, afforded the assembled delegates ‘the opportunity
to smile indulgently at the errors of judgement and the crises which marked the times of our
predecessors and to happily design futures in which our advanced knowledge and technology will
ensure that succeeding generations will have no cause to smile indulgently because of our
mistakes. Sadly, however, I fear we face the same fate as those who have gone before us.’ Dawes,
‘The Future of Australian Prisons - An Australian View’, in David Biles, (ed.), Current
International Trends in Corrections, Federation Press, Sydney, 1988, p. 62.

  If American progressives had, as David Rothman pointed out ‘seen their predecessors as
genuinely devoted to doing good, then [they] would have had to reckon seriously with the
possibility of their own failure…this thought was too dark for men and women with a new mission
to consider.’ Rothman, Conscience and Convenience: The Asylum and its Alternatives in
Progressive America, Little, Brown and Co, Boston, 1980, p. 60.

                                              309

served if they had aimed to help inmates deal with the problems and behaviours that gave
rise to escapes, and to explain the real nature of escapes to the public.


Policy-makers who seriously considered this history could also distil a few insights about
the consequences of reform for staff. As J. E. Thomas has observed, ‘no prison system
will move in any direction’ without the cooperation of its employees.5 Politicians,
penologists, and prisoners have all long agreed on the importance of good staff. For the
most part though, it seems the prisons services had little idea how to recruit such
individuals, or find enough money to pay them appropriately. Bureaucrats spoke
frequently of training and education, but were unable to connect the presence or absence
of such staff to wider reform agendas. Although their moment has passed, the camps
suggest that if reform is to have any chance of success, it must be formulated with the
needs of the people who have to implement it in mind.


The camps also shed light on how we might approach the central problem in the
administration of justice. For centuries now, reformers, administrators, criminologists,
leaders, keepers and prisoners have thought, talked, written and argued about how to iron
the criminal kink out of offenders. The camps were quickly proclaimed to be great
successes in this regard, but the judgement was premature. As an exercise in the reform
and management of the prison, the camps were undoubtedly successful, but it turned out
to be much easier to repair the image of the prisons than it was to rehabilitate criminals.
On some level, prisons staff understood this and, as a result, became increasingly
disillusioned with the concept of rehabilitation, both in relation to the camps in particular
and more broadly. J. D. was one such officer. He joined the Victorian prison service in
1937, and rose to be the Governor of McLeod Prison Farm, before he retired in 1974.
Shortly before leaving the service, he admitted to his superior, Eric Shade:


        I have seen prisons change from places of punishment only to ones where
        hopefully some change for the better could be instilled in prisoners…but in my
        opinion the results have been disappointing. I am convinced that rehabilitation
        cannot be effected in a prison atmosphere, most aspects of prison life are against
        it.6

Many have come to share this view. Since the late 1970s, around the world and in
Australia, there has been          diminution of faith in the rehabilitative ideal amongst
penologists; many have argued that ‘nothing works’.7 The same period has also seen a
rise in punitive penal practices. Maximum penalties for offences have been increased,
sentences have got longer, prisons have been privatised, budgets for rehabilitative
programs have been cut, and prison populations have risen.8


I would argue that the apparent failure of rehabilitative penology to fulfil the hopes held
for it does not warrant a retreat to a tougher form of ‘justice’. One can be idealistic and
agree with Herman Kling, the former Swedish Minister of Justice, who said: ‘We must
practice humanity without expecting anything in return. Humanitarianism should be
regarded as a fundamental obligation to mankind, no matter where it leads.’9 However,
one does not need to hold such righteous sentiments to believe that it is worth persevering
with the idea of rehabilitation.


By the end of his career, John Morony had a complicated view of these matters. As a
young officer, by his own admission he had ‘unwarranted expectations’ of the prison
system. But to his credit, the disappointment he felt when he realised he had set his hopes
too high did not turn him into a cynic. With a strange pragmatism, Morony came down
in favour of a necessary illusion:


        it was de Tocqueville, who, writing of the American prison scene, said that the
        object of the administration, to so correct the offenders that crime would cease to
        be, was an illusion. It is quite probable that he is right but nevertheless it is an
        illusion upon which all forward-thinking prison administration must be based.10

   This catch-cry was based—inaccurately as it turns out—on the findings of a landmark study:
Douglas Lipton, Robert Martinson and Judith Wilks, The effectiveness of correctional treatment: a
survey of treatment evaluation studies, Praeger, New York, 1975.

Morony could be right, it might be necessary for administrators to believe in an
impossibility in order to maintain certain minimum standards. It might also be too soon to
say whether De Tocqueville’s dismal prophecy has come true. At an international
conference in 1975, amongst increasingly disillusioned colleagues, the criminologists
Peter Lejins and Denis Szabo argued in favour of patient optimism. As we have seen,
early twentieth-century criminologists used the language of medicine to support grand
theories, but Szabo and Legins drew a humbler analogy with the world of medical
science. They pointed out that around the world, thousands of researchers had for many
years diligently worked to find a cure for cancer and made little progress. No one called
for that project to be abandoned. The fact that efforts to address the problem of crime had
met with scant success should not be a source of despair, Szabo and Legins counselled.
Rather it should be read as a compelling invitation to further work.11


One does not have to believe that science will one day rid society of crime to see the
wisdom in Szabo and Legin’s words. Prison reform is not a steady march towards an
ever-better future, no matter how intensely we might wish it were. But nor is it static.
With a little determination and imagination, some things can be improved, and we are not
at the end of the story. As he left the world of prison management, John Morony said that
‘the future is neither dark nor bright, but it is indistinct’.12
