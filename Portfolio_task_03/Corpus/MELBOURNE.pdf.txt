"It is seldom," says the Brisbane Courier,

"that a prisoner after effecting his escape

from a penal establishment, and enjoying

several years of freedom, is found to yield

himself up to the authorities with the in-

tention of performing the portion of his

sentence which remained unexpired at the

time of his escape, but a case of the kind

has occurred here within the last few days.

On the 4th August, 1866, a man named

Charles Court, who was undergoing a sentence

of five years' penal servitude at St. Helena,

for horse-stealing, contrived to escape in a

boat with a fellow-prisoner, and get clear

away. Court made his way to New South

Wales, and from all accounts he appears to

have behaved well during the last five years,

and to so far raise himself in the estimation

of a well-to-do relative that the latter

promised to make him his heir on condition

that he returned to Queensland and fulfilled

his term of imprisonment. The wisdom of

this proceeding is self-apparent, for should

Court be discovered at any future time, his

arrest would follow as a matter of course,

and the disgrace might then be more severely

felt. Acting, therefore, on the advice of his

friends, he travelled overland to Warwick,

and surrendered himself to the police there.

He has four years and one month of his

sentence to serve."
