               Abstract
               Due to the increasing speed of landscape changes and the massive development of
               computer technologies, the methods of representing heritage landscapes using
               digital tools have become a worldwide concern in conservation research. The aim
               of this paper is to demonstrate how an ‘interpretative model’ can be used for
               contextual design of heritage landscape information systems. This approach is
               explored through building a geographic information system database for St
               Helena Island national park in Moreton Bay, South East Queensland, Australia.
               Stakeholders’ interpretations of this landscape were collected through interviews,
               and then used as a framework for designing the database. The designed database
               is a digital inventory providing contextual descriptions of the historic infrastruc-
               ture remnants on St Helena Island. It also reveals the priorities of different sites in
               terms of historic research, landscape restoration, and tourism development. Addi-
               tionally, this database produces thematic maps of the intangible heritage values,
               which could be used for landscape interpretation. This approach is different from
               the existing methods because building a heritage information system is deemed as
               an interpretative activity, rather than a value-free replication of the physical
               environment. This approach also shows how a cultural landscape methodology
               can be used to create a flexible information system for heritage conservation. The
               conclusion is that an ‘interpretative model’ of database design facilitates a more
               explicit focus on information support, and is a potentially effective approach to
               user-centred design of geographic information systems.
