From the Courier

The Courier gives the following particulars
respecting the escape and recapture of two prisoners
at St. Helena: â€” At noon, on Saturday, the Visit-
ing Justice, Mr. T. H. Barron, Inspector Lewis,
and a body of police, with a black tracker, pro-
ceeded to St. Helena Penal Establishment to assist
in searching for two prisoners who had escaped from
the working gangs engaged cutting down the man-
grove scrub. On their arrival they found that the
Water Police and Customs boats had been guarding
the island all night, and had made diligent search
during the morning. They had tracked the two
runaways to the beach and back, and also found a
rudely constructed raft, made of bits of small drift
wood, about a quarter of a mile from the beach, to
seaward, which led the searchers to believe that the
prisoners had either been attacked by sharks or
drowned, as the raft was only sufficient to hold on
to by the hands, the body bung immersed. Infor-
mation reached town on Sunday that the two
prisoners were recaptured on Saturday night. Had
they succeeded in getting away from the island,
there is little doubt that they must have been
drowned, as the wind and tide would have taken
them out to sea by the north passage. The
prisoners are both young men, the eldest being
William Read, who was convicted of horse-stealing
at Roma on the 21st April last, and sentenced to
seven years' penal servitude. The other, named
James English, was convicted at the same place for
a less offence in July, 1867, and sentenced to five
years' imprisonment.
