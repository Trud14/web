Stone walls do a prison make: law on the
landscape

By: Chris Dawson


The imposition of a new and dominant system of law was an important part of
the European settlement of Queensland. Imprisonment was the main form of
punishment under this system, and prisons became tangible artefacts of the
spread of these new laws across the colony. Prison walls created strict divisions
in the landscape, separating the free world on the outside from the unfree world
on the inside, where people were redefined as ‘prisoners’ and became the
property of the state, subject to a strictly regulated regime.

A new form of punishment

The use of long-term imprisonment as punishment was a relatively new idea in
the early nineteenth century, and was unknown within Aboriginal cultures,
where exile and physical punishment were among the legal sanctions. To be
locked in prison became a defacto form of exile for Aborigines, as it restricted
them from conducting vital cultural practices in their own country. This
contributed to their suffering inside prisons, and Aboriginal deaths in custody
were an issue from the earliest days of colonisation. In 1853 a Brisbane judge
commented on the conditions in Sydney’s Cockatoo Island prison:

‘It was a painful consideration that the punishment at Cockatoo was felt ten
times more severely by the blacks than by the whites, and most of them die.
Recently, one who had sentence of death commuted, and was sent there,
suffered most acutely, and died in seven weeks. But there appeared no
alternative, for if they were sent to the gaol here, or to the Newcastle breakwater,
they would very probably escape.’ (Moreton Bay Free Press, 29 November 1853)

Civic pride and fear

The presence and quality of a prison reflected the status of towns in the young
colony. During the 1840s-50s, Brisbane and Ipswich competed to become the
preeminent population centre in the north of the colony, and civic authorities
lobbied to have a new prison built in their own town. The local preeminence of
Brisbane was indicated in 1846 when the New South Wales government decided
to convert a former convict building on Queen Street into a prison. However,
only £820 was allocated to construct the prison, as compared to the £13,000
that had been spent on Sydney’s Darlinghurst Gaol in 1841. In the same week
that the new Brisbane prison opened, it was described in the Moreton Bay
Courier on 5 January 1850 as being ‘not sufficiently secure’ due to careless
workmanship. The decaying porphyry-block structure was repeatedly criticised
throughout the 1850s as being too small, rickety, and out-of-date with new
penological trends. Plans for a new gaol were delayed by the ongoing uncertainty
over Separation, with the New South Wales government unwilling to spend
freely in what might soon be a separate colony.

The first public building to open in Brisbane following Separation was the prison
on Petrie Terrace, built at a cost of £26,000 and subject to proud boasts in local
newspapers. The new prisons that opened around the colony during the next

decade indicated the growing importance of certain towns, although there were
times when local residents opposed prisons in those towns. A group of
prominent Toowoomba citizens, for example, petitioned against the presence of
a predominately female prison in 1870, as reported in Queensland Votes and
Proceedings, arguing that when ‘women of ill-fame’ were released they would
‘resort to crimes of the most flagitious and demoralizing character’.

The growing network

The spread of European settlement throughout colonial Queensland was
mirrored by the expanding prison system. While there was only one prison in the
colony at the time of Separation in 1859, ten years later there were four. By the
1890s there were prisons as far north as Thursday Island and Normanton. The
growth of the sugar and mining industries played a role in this expansion,
and decline in those industries resulted in the closure or downgrading of
some prisons.

Nineteenth century police gaols

The prison network was supported by police gaols, which were small, police-
managed facilities, larger than the usual lockups attached to police stations, and
holding short-term prisoners serving two weeks or less. Police gaols could be
upgraded to official prisons (or prisons downgraded to police gaols) according to
local requirements and population fluctuations. The remote gaol at Camooweal,
for example, was opened specifically to restrict the movement of unlicensed

Chinese miners into Queensland from the west, but a few years later, following
the decline of the mining industry and the introduction of immigration
restrictions, the now-empty gaol was deemed surplus to requirements and was
closed.

State Farms

State farms, or ‘honour prisons’, are low-security facilities used to house low-risk
inmates. The first of these opened at Palen Creek, south of Brisbane near the
NSW border, in 1934 and was the first prison in the Commonwealth to have no
security measures, relying entirely on the honour of the prisoners not to escape.

Several more state farms opened during the next decade, a physical expansion of
the classification scheme as low-security prisoners were moved away from urban
centres.

Twentieth century prisons

Most of the colonial prison infrastructure in Queensland was replaced during the
twentieth century, and the only nineteenth century prison building still in
operational use is at Townsville. The prisons in many regional towns, such as
Roma, Cooktown, Mackay and Cairns, were closed as the system became more
centralised, although rural locations were utilised for low-security inmates.

As criminal justice requirements expanded in line with a growing population,
various prison buildings became obsolete and were demolished and replaced
with larger facilities at places like Rockhampton and Boggo Road. These prisons
gradually moved out of urban centres and into the fringes of major towns and
cities.

Wacol

In 1957 a prison opened at Wacol, halfway between Brisbane and Ipswich. This
site had been proposed as a good location for a prison as early as 1893, according
to the Comptroller General’s Prisons Report, 1894. Over the following decades
several new buildings were added and modified as Wacol became the largest
prison complex in Queensland.

Prison troubles

Discontent was rife in the Queensland prison system throughout the twentieth
century, peaking in the 1970s and 80s when outdated infrastructure and
overcrowding led to a series of riots, hunger strikes, escapes, staff unrest and
unflattering headlines. Once again the State government launched inquiries into
the dysfunctional system in an attempt to modernise it. The Bredhauer Report of
1973 and the Kennedy Report of 1988 resulted in major reforms in the housing
and treatment of inmates, and led to the eventual closure of all the Boggo Road
prisons, including the recently-built female prison demolished in 2007.

Deaths in custody, which were disproportionately high among Indigenous
inmates, remained an important issue and was investigated by the Royal
Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody during 1987-91. Despite

recommendations designed to reduce Aboriginal custodial levels and deaths in
custody, the situation failed to improve.

The general Queensland prison population more than doubled during the 1990s,
an outcome of improved policing techniques, more fine defaulters being
imprisoned, an increase in short-term sentences in place of community service
orders, and an increase in the length of sentences served according to the
Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, Prisoner Numbers in Queensland
Report, 2000. This led to the largest and most expensive expansion of prison
capacity ever seen in Queensland.
