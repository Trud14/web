       superintendent.                                        On          one   occasion   the
       bread                  was             very            raw.            The.   superin

       next              day,             told            the          warder                      baker               to
       cook              the  bread better.                                        He         was,             how
       ever,              ready   with  an                                    excuse,                  saying
       that          he        had             omitted                 to     close   a              slide on
       the           door       of the   oven.                                          About                  three
       days              later,  the bread                                   was             worse              than

            This                                             of'             is
                   warder    baker         in charge
       the   kitchen, having         under    his    charge
       nine prisoners.         The     way     he    abuses
       these    men    Is a  disgrace      to the     estab
       lishment.       This warder       has    locked up
       more     men.    during     the   12   months        he
       has           been                on         SL        Helena                    than           all          the
       rest          of        the            warders                  at          St.        Helena.                     I
       have    known      him    to lock     a   prisoner up
       and    put a charge        against       him      for   ab
       solutely nothing.          Thanks,        however,         to
       the     superintendent          they        wero        not
       punished.        I  can    name      from        memory
       nearly     30    prisoners      this warder             has
       had    punished       within     the     space' of 12
       months.       No   doubt     surprise will be ex
       pressed why         this warder         is allowed         to
       go on    like this.      Well, I may         state     that
       within                 the             last        two            years               there              have
