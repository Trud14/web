We are promised a good riddance of bad rub-

bish. The Government have made up their mind

to get rid of that eyesore to Brisbane — the gaol,

and to remove the prisoners to St. Helena, there

to cultivate sugar. The gaol will, when the last

prisoner has left it, be pulled down, and the site

and materials converted into hard cash, of which

a good amount should be realised. The gaol

is not only an eyesore, but it is a

place of torture as well. It is quite

unfit for habitation, even by prisoners, some of the

cells, during hot weather, being veritable ovens,

in which the unhappy inmate can scarce draw

breath. The prison, too, is considerably over-

looked by houses, and is altogether demoralising

to the crowded neighbourhood in which it stands.

The preliminary step towards a complete clear out

has just been taken by the Colonial Secretary,

who has just informed the head gaoler and chief

turnkey that their services will no longer be re-

quired.
