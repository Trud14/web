island of the past

James McPherson was an apprentice stonemason to the renowned Petrie family
in Brisbane and a horsebreaker in Queensland in the 1860’s¹, but quickly
realized the career of a bushranger would lead to a far more adventurous and
colourful life. Having not been paid for his work, and James took revenge by
stealing two horses and headed to New South Wales, joining bushranger
Gardener’s gang at the age of around 21. After too many brushes with the police
he returned to Queensland 2 and set about earning an individual reputation as
‘The Wild Scotchman.’

He quickly became a well-known identity, assuming many aliases including
James Bruce, Kerr and Alpin McPherson, 4 allowing him easier movement
around the state. His bush ranging career began with with the shooting of Mr
Willis at a hotel in Houghton River in March 1864, where he stole a horse, three
cabbage tree hats, two pairs of riding pants, one pair of boots, one gun, one
crimean shirt, one bottle of whisky, and fourteen pounds of flour. 5

He fled to New South Wales to fight a duel with Sir Frederick Potinger, a
prominent Police Inspector dedicated to the extermination of bushrangers.¹
Shots were exchanged near Wheogo on the 17th August where he was wounded
on his left arm and fled. On the 27th October, he held up a mailman 16 miles
from Scone. He was finally captured near Billabong Creek on the 11th February
1865.

He was sent to Sydney to face trial for the attempted murder of Sir Frederick,
but upon Sir Frederick’s death was extradited to Bowen, Qld on the 8th April
1865 to face the charge of shooting Mr Willis. 1 Placed on the boat ‘Diamantina’
for his upcoming trial at Rockhampton, he escaped from the boat on the 9th
June 1865 as his hands were too small for the handcuffs he was restrained in.

By August he was charged on warrant for stealing horses and cattle and in
October he robbed the Condamine Mail and Taroom Mail. A reward for £50 was
placed on his head, later increased to £250. His spree of highway robberies
continued. He headed towards Gayndah in November 1865 went on a spree,
stealing a gun and clothing and robbing 6 mail coaches and 4 individuals in

around Gayndah and Nanango. He was finally captured on the 30th March 1866.

At the Nanago robbery, McPherson was said to give the driver McCullum:

     “a letter duly stamped and closed, addressed to ‘His Excellency Sir
     George Ferguson Bowen, Brisbane, Queensland,’ and with it a
     package that was to be given to Mr. Bligh. The bushranger obtained
     McCullum’s promise to post the first, and deliver the second of these,
     and informed the mailman the package contained the useless
     cheques taken out of the Maryborough and Gayndah mails… The
     letter to his Excellency was duly posted, and we learn, by our
     telegraphic news, that his Excellency received it, and found that it
     contained cheques and bills amounting to £1700.” 6

To one of the mailmen he said ‘would not have stuck it up only he had told the
Maryborough mailman he would do so, 5 and though only a poor devil of a
bushranger, he always kept his word’ and ‘he had stuck up the mail to show them
his defiance.’ While sitting on the ground opening letters during one robbery, he
considerately folded up those that contained no money and returned them to
their envelopes. 6 During these bushranging years, many people fed or offered
him a bed. He would eat quietly, read the papers and leave a coin behind. He was
renowned for his manners and intelligence, cool daring and clever tactics.

Captured at Monduran Station on the 30th March 1866 in an attempted hold up,
he was acquitted for the shooting in Bowen, but a trial in Maryborough saw him
charged with Bushranging on the 13th September 1866 and found guilty.

Sentence:

2 counts of Mail Robbery under arms

Sentence: 25 years for each crime – to be served concurrently

Sentence date: September 1866

James was held in Brisbane Gaol from September till February 18703 when he
was transferred to St Helena Penal Establishment. Arriving only 3 years after the
prison had officially opened, his Administration number upon arrival at St
Helena was 160, meaning he was the 160th prisoner admitted into the prison.

Within 2 months of his arrival, James decided on some drastic action. Watch the
video below to find out more.
