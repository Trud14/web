       The north end of Stradbroke is named Amity Point , so called
 after the brig “ Amity ,," which brought up the first convicts in
 September , 1824. Here Major Lockyer landed in 1825.           In April,
 1836 , it was visited by Backhouse and Walker , the Quaker missionaries ,
 by McGillivray , the naturalist , and the now famous Professor Huxley ,
who landed from the “ Rattlesnake " on           8th October , 1847 . All
these visitors saw the blacks fishing with the porpoises , and described
the natives as fine athletic men . There are several small lakes on both
islands. On Stradbroke , wallabies and kangaroos are numerous ; but
no bears or opossums are found on any part of the island . On
Morton there was no animal life except snakes and iguanas .
       Amity Point has been the favourite dugong fishing station
periodically since 1846 .
       On the Bar, at the entrance , the steamer “ Sovereign " was
wrecked on the 11th March , 1817 , and only ten people saved out of
fifty - four.
