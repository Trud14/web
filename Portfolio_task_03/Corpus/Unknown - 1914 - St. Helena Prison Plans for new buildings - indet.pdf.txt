ST. HELENA PRISON.

PLANS TOR NEW BUILDINGS.

INDETERMINATE SENTENCES.

Plans have been prepared for the erection of new prison buildings on the island of St Helena These have
been sent to the Comptroller of Prisons but owing to that gentle-man's absence through illness they have
not yet been considered and passed on to the Home Secretary. Mr. Appel said -yesterday that they will
come to him for approval after they had been considered. He had, however, seen the sketch plans. The
new prison buildings would be of brick and concrete, to make them more resistant to fire than the pre-sent
wooden buildings. The isolation would be higher and better, being open to the prevailing breeze, so that
there would be ample ventilation. The prison would be on the most modem and up-to-date lines. Single
cells would replace the associated cells, and provision would be made for lighting the quarters of the
prisoners who secured privileges by good conduct.

In speaking of the proposal to adopt the principle of indeterminate sentences, as suggested by several
members of the Bench, Mr. Appel said that this was one of the matters to which he proposed to give his
at-tention during his tour in the South. Indeterminate sentences were im-posed in New South Wales. There
was much to be said on both sides on this question. He was rather inclined to the idea personally. He
admitted that there were dangers of long imprisonment, but pointed out that the idea, underlying the
system was to keep persons in confinement until they showed some indication of reformation.
