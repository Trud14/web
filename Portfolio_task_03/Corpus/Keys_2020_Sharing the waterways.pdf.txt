Abstract
        This research examines the role that fear of sharks has played in the history of
        St Helena Island Moreton Bay, Queensland through analysis of historical
        records, newspapers, photographs and literature. The article begins with
        Aboriginal histories of St Helena Island, colonial settlement of the region and
        the building of a quarantine station. An exploration of the ways in which settlers’
        fear of sharks supported the detention of prisoners in the St Helena Island
        Penal Establishment follows. The research <U+FB01>nds that the warders’ shark-proof
        swimming enclosure on St Helena Island (1916) records a time when Queensland
        communities were <U+FB01>rst seeking to manage the recreational demands of
        swimmers in the context of a growing public fear of sharks.




Introduction
Focusing on the early history of St Helena Island, this research considers the role
sharks have played in the settlement and occupation of Moreton Bay, Queensland.
It is argued that the shark-proof swimming enclosure built at St Helena Penal
Establishment in 1916 re<U+FB02>ects the growth of swimming as a leisure activity within a
speci<U+FB01>c cultural context of European settlers’ fear of sharks. Sharing the waterways
with sharks is an ongoing challenge for Queensland communities. The marine
life-rich waters of Moreton Bay and the Brisbane River are a natural habitat to
a diverse range of shark species. As the water-based recreational activities of
South-East Queensland’s population grow, so have the numbers of encounters
between people and sharks. Heightened media attention and public concern around
the increased (but still rare) incidence of unprovoked shark attacks have contributed
to a disproportional perceived fear of fatal shark attacks in Australia, one that is not
supported by the actual rates of fatal shark events recorded.1
    The fear of sharks has been a ‘terror’ associated with living near the tropical
waters of the state of Queensland since colonial settlement. This fear has justi<U+FB01>ed

      ongoing strategies to protect humans from sharks, such as drum lines and shark nets
      that have been in place along popular Queensland beaches since 1962.2 The fear of
      sharks was also used as leverage against people detained on St Helena Island in
      Moreton Bay. St Helena Island was used by the Queensland Government as a self-
      sustaining and highly secure penal establishment between 1867 and 1933, holding
      the state’s long-sentence male prisoners. Escape from the island was partly deterred
      by the expanse of surrounding waters and the perceived fear that human-eating
      sharks inhabited these waters. Once a large institution, most penal buildings on
      St Helena Island have since been demolished. Archival digital scans done in 2016
      have recorded for posterity the few restored timber structures and remaining
      masonry features on the island, including the rusting remains of a shark-proof
      swimming enclosure built in 1916.3 It can still be seen today by recreational boaters
      and tourists arriving at the National Park jetty at the end of the original causeway at
      St Helena Island (Figure 1).
             On 4 April 2017, the fear of sharks became a local issue for South-East
      Queensland residents when the national newspaper The Australian, ran the head-
      line, ‘Shark Attacks Kayaker in Moreton Bay, Off Brisbane’, describing a ‘terri<U+FB01>ed’
      man being rescued by water police near Mud Island, adjacent to St Helena Island,
      after the rear of his kayak was bitten off by a shark.4 Since 2018, the reporting of
      fatal shark attacks in popular tourist spots of Northern Queensland has again
      sensationally dominated news cycles. While the incidents of shark attacks occurred
      in regions remote from the densely populated capital city of Brisbane, the media
      reports feed into an ongoing narrative that the threat of fatal attack by a shark is
      ever-present.

    Shark barriers or shark-proof swimming enclosures designed to protect people
from shark attacks are increasingly advocated nowadays as both marine conserva-
tion concerns and the effectiveness of existing shark-reduction strategies are
debated.5 St Helena Island’s shark-proof swimming enclosure is a rare surviving
example of the use of steel railway tracks to create the walls of the swimming
enclosure. We will return to this swimming enclosure later. First, an examination of
the social and cultural context for its construction will begin with settlement on the
island, Queensland’s early record of penal detention and punishment, and the role
of sharks in this history.

Aboriginal histories of Noogoon
Located in Moreton Bay about 6 kilometres from the mouth of the Brisbane River,
St Helena Island is 88 hectares in area and rises to 21 metres above sea level with
closest landfall being Mud and Green Islands.6 The island was known to the
Quandamooka Aboriginal people as Noogoon.7 The history of Noogoon was
documented in 1984 by Gillian Alfredson, in an archaeology Honours thesis
focusing on the Aboriginal use of the island as well as in two books on the penal
establishment, one by Lauren Penny and one by Jarvis Finger.8 The site, which has
attracted tourists and school groups since the 1970s, was declared a Historic Area in
September 1979; it is on the Queensland Heritage List and currently managed by
Queensland National Parks.9
   St Helena Island sits within the social and cultural environments of
Quandamooka, which are the waters and lands of the Greater Moreton Bay region
of South-East Queensland. Between 10,000 and 12,000 Aboriginal people lived in
this region before 1800, resulting in one of the highest population densities in
pre-contact Australia. Substantial social and ceremonial gatherings were a cyclic
feature of Aboriginal social life in this region, supported by mutual reciprocity in
terms of travel and movement between language groups in coastal and inland
regions – movement underpinned by skills in swimming and boating. A stable social
and political organisation existed among the distinct groups of Aboriginal people of
the region, who recognised clans with independent spheres of authority, law and
land rights.10
   Dugong (Dugong dugon) <U+FB02>ourished in the surrounding seagrasses, banks of
oysters grew nearby, a low water table provided year-round freshwater and the
fertile volcanic soil supported mangrove <U+FB02>ats, a small area of grassland, a lagoon
and a thick covering of subtropical vine forest.11 Seasonal arrivals of colonies of
large migratory fruit bats (Pteropus policephalus) were harvested for food.12
Archaeological investigations have revealed that Aboriginal people visited
Noogoon seasonally to exploit its resources for over 2,500 years.13
   Reaching Noogoon by island-hopping signi<U+FB01>cant distances, canoeing, swimming
and walking across sand bars, these stays were of a short-term nature, with midden
heaps providing an extraordinary visual and physical record of Aboriginal people’s
ongoing visitation and management of the island and its nearby terrestrial as well as
marine resources. Quandamooka Aboriginal people held religious beliefs that
involved close, often collaborative relationships with marine animals, including
a close <U+FB01>shing relationship with dolphins.14 These middens record a rich diet
that included sharks, <U+FB01>sh and <U+FB02>ying foxes, as well as lizards, dugong and turtles.

      Evidence was also found of mud crabs, oysters, mussels, whelk shells and land snails
      alongside bream, mullet, tarwhine, whiting, cat<U+FB01>sh, stone<U+FB01>sh and the diminutive
      Weasel shark (Rhizoprionodon taylori).15
         Noogoon and the waters around it were <U+FB01>rst mapped by Europeans in 1799
      when British explorer Matthew Flinders anchored the sloop the Norfolk alongside
      the small heavily timbered island on the evening of the 19 July while performing a
      two-week survey of what is now known as Moreton Bay. Noting the mangrove
      forests and mud<U+FB02>ats that surrounded Noogoon on his survey chart, Finders
      observed the island’s height and ‘dark and luxuriant’ foliage relative to other
      nearby islands.16 This survey marked the beginning of an increasing presence of
      Europeans in the region, with Quandamooka people’s livelihoods, access to their
      traditional lands and wellbeing signi<U+FB01>cantly impacted by the spread of colonial
      settlement beginning in the 1820s.17

      Post-contact histories of Noogoon
      The British colonial impetus to settle in Moreton Bay came from Royal Commis-
      sioner John Bigge (1819–22), who argued that additional isolated penal settlements
      were required on the tropical coastline of what is now Queensland to hold and
      deter secondary convict offenders.18 John Oxley was sent to the region on several
      reconnaissance missions from 1823.19 Following Oxley’s surveys and the
      subsequent ‘discovery’ of the Brisbane River, a ship was sent from Sydney to
      found a convict penal settlement in Moreton Bay in 1824. A brief survey of
      Noogoon was made on 13 September 1824 to this end, but it revealed a lack of
      suf<U+FB01>cient fresh water. Instead, the <U+FB01>rst penal settlement in Moreton Bay was located
      at Red Cliffe Point. Red Cliffe Point was abandoned in less than a year, and the
      penal settlement relocated to Brisbane Town, a new site on the banks of Brisbane
      River. Here convicts housed in barracks were organised into work gangs on major
      public works under civil law and policing. A small gaol room and some solitary cells
      were constructed in 1827.20
         During the voyage to Brisbane Town, large ocean-going ships carrying supplies
      and passengers <U+FB01>rst had to navigate the very treacherous waters and sand bars
      between Moreton Island and Minjerriba (Stradbroke Island) into Moreton Bay.
      The job of piloting the increasing volume of ships was <U+FB01>rst performed by a retired
      Royal Navy Lieutenant, John Tosh from the 17th Regiment. Assisted by hand-
      picked convicts, a small military guard and local Aboriginal people, Tosh held
      this job from 1825 until 1830, when the pilot boat overturned and he was
      reportedly taken by sharks, becoming the <U+FB01>rst recorded fatality by a shark
      attack.21
         A second and larger penal outstation on Stradbroke Island was built at Goompi
      (Green Point or Dunwich) to store goods before carting on smaller boats into
      Brisbane Town or loading onto larger vessels for the return trip to Sydney.22
      Aboriginal people lived and worked in these colonial outstations, employed in
      piloting, and in the <U+FB01>shing and dugong industries.23 Aboriginal people’s pro<U+FB01>ciency
      as swimmers was recognised and they were regularly involved in saving drowning
      shipwrecked Europeans.24 However, as had been the case in Australian frontier
      towns since European colonisation, con<U+FB02>ict between Aboriginal people and settlers
      revealed vast differences in legal understandings about land use.

   From the 1820s, early convict punishment and the rule of law in Queensland
involved the in<U+FB02>iction of physical pain and was enforced by the state in a
paternalistic and personal way, but convicts enjoyed some freedoms of association
and limited free time. At this time, public executions and <U+FB02>oggings were enacted,
reinforcing the deterrent value placed on punishment. Libby Connors has argued
that in relation to the Aboriginal population of Queensland, of<U+FB01>cial punishment
was extreme and intended to make an example of the individual to deter the broader
Aboriginal community.25 However, it took the colonists time to work out what was
the most effective type of punishment. In March 1828, an Aboriginal man called
Eulope, but known to colonists as ‘Napoleon’, was caught stealing an axe at
Dunwich on Stradbroke Island. He was named Napoleon due to his leadership and
supposed physical resemblance to the famous French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte,
who was exiled after a defeat in 1815 to a remote British-held island in the South
Atlantic Ocean called St Helena, where he died a prisoner.26
   Thinking detention on an ‘isolated’ island in the middle of Moreton Bay the best
way to punish the ‘black Napoleon’, Commandant Logan exiled Eulope on
Noogoon. However, Eulope spent less than three days on Noogoon making a
bark canoe before paddling and navigating the signi<U+FB01>cant distance across the bay to
his family on Stradbroke Island.27 Following this legendary act of de<U+FB01>ance, by 1848
the island was known to European settlers as St Helena.28
   The number of convicts in Brisbane peaked in 1831. In Sydney and England,
<U+FB02>ogging was replaced of<U+FB01>cially as a form of deterrent and punishment by con<U+FB01>ne-
ment in solitary cells from the 1820s.29 However, Brisbane Town, especially under
Captain Logan, was renowned for its culture of cruelty and excessive public
<U+FB02>ogging, a practice that continued through to the late 1840s. Logan justi<U+FB01>ed his
reliance on the lash on the lack of a gaol.30 By 1839, most convicts had been
withdrawn from the settlement and the Moreton Bay penal colony was made
available to free settlers in 1842.31 European arrivals observed sharks in the waters
of the bay, with British explorers on HMS Rattlesnake visiting Moreton Bay in 1847
noting that, ‘Sharks are numerous close to the beach but were generally small and
harmless; one of the natives, however, had lost his foot at the ankle joint from the
bite of one.’32 On land, a period of intense frontier con<U+FB02>ict spread outwards from
Brisbane Town during the 1840s, with surviving Aboriginal people’s lifestyles
disrupted by European arrivals, often in violent death.33
   The numbers of people imprisoned for breaking the law soon began to outstrip
the space in the existing colonial gaols. In 1847, another gaol was provided by
retro<U+FB01>tting the old Female Factory (1837) in Queens Street. As the population of
Brisbane grew rapidly during the 1850s, with 14,000 people settled through the
Port of Moreton Bay between 1848 and 1859, the wards of the old Female Factory
gaol were soon overcrowded and insecure, despite the practice of sending longer-
term inmates to Sydney and extensions to the gaol were made in 1853 after a mass
breakout attempt.34 However, by 1857 the visiting surgeon was concerned that
overcrowding, tropical heat and lack of ventilation would lead to an outbreak of
gaol fever. Designs were drawn up for a new gaol in 1857 by the Clerk of Works
and architect Charles Tif<U+FB01>n. After Queensland separated from New South Wales in
December 1859, the <U+FB01>rst public building in the new state was Petrie Terrace gaol,
which was constructed in 1860.35

         Calls to improve public hygiene in the tropical heat also saw the increasing
      popularity of public bathing. The <U+FB01>rst swimming enclosures were built in Queens-
      land during the 1840s, with Brisbane’s <U+FB01>rst public baths built on the banks of the
      river in 1856. Initially used for bathing and later recreational swimming, <U+FB02>oating
      and <U+FB01>xed baths, in-ground pools and beachside swimming enclosures supported the
      growing popularity of recreational and competitive swimming among male settlers
      from the 1860s. It would not be until early1903 that the <U+FB01>rst Ladies Swimming Club
      was formed in Brisbane and nearly a year later when women were able to access
      segregated seaside swimming session at Sandgate baths.36
         A boom of migration from Europe into Queensland and increasing incursion of
      settlers into Aboriginal lands during the late nineteenth century saw a rise in frontier
      con<U+FB02>icts and arrests, which meant that Petrie Terrace gaol was soon full and the
      British practice of locking prisoners into unseaworthy ships was required. By 1864,
      male prisoners were secured in a hulk moored at the mouth of the Brisbane River.37
      At this time in Moreton Bay, the highly pro<U+FB01>table commercial slaughter of dugong
      depended on the tracking, hunting and seafaring prowess of Quandamooka
      Aboriginal people.38 From the mid-1850s, St Helena Island was a base for dugong
      processing, with the netting process attracting sharks: ‘During the boiling session,
      numbers of sharks lurked about the nets, and while feeding upon the entrapped
      Dugong, frequently became entangled in the nets themselves.’39
         For migrants settling in Queensland, sharks were one of many new threats
      associated with living in the tropics. By-products of dugong processing at St Helena
      and Amity Point likely increased sharks’ activity in these areas. Booming immigrant
      populations also meant more bathers and human waste in the Brisbane River.
      Reports of fatal shark attacks began to <U+FB01>lter into the mainstream press during the
      1860s, increasing European awareness and fear of sharks like the Tiger Shark in the
      region (Figure 2).
             In December 1862, under the heading, ‘A Melancholy Occurrence. – Caution
      to bathers’, it was reported in the Courier newspaper that an Aboriginal boy had
      been taken in the Brisbane River on the bank opposite the racecourse trying to
      retrieve an injured bird:
         A black boy : : : jumped in after it; when about thirty yards from it he saw a large
         shark. He immediately turned round and dived for the shore, but the shark still
         pursued him. He dived three times, but upon his rising the third time the shark was
         seen to turn upon his belly and seize the boy, who gave one scream and
         disappeared : : : it may act as a warning to many who now bathe in the river.40
      In 1889, the Brisbane Courier reported an event that occurred twenty-six years
      earlier when two sharks killed a new settler to Moreton Bay in April 1863.
      It described how a party of <U+FB01>fteen immigrants had been separated from their
      clipper, The Queen of the Colonies, after burying a Mrs Barns<U+FB01>eld on Moreton
      Island who had died within sight of land. Shipwrecked near what is now known as
      Caloundra and without provisions, the castaways unsuccessfully tried to relaunch
      their boat. During this attempt, ‘Mr Barns<U+FB01>eld : : : was seized and devoured by two
      sharks before their eyes’.41
         Boats were the main form of transport, with migrants arriving in Moreton Bay
      after long sea voyages from Europe and the Paci<U+FB01>c Islands. Crowded conditions on
      these vessels meant many arrivals were sickly. Some, like Mrs Barns<U+FB01>eld, died in

transit while others brought contagious diseases.42 The colonial response was to set
up quarantine stations, detaining migrants on islands that were removed from the
main settlement and where medical doctors checked their health. Dunwich on
Stradbroke Island initially served this role, but a signi<U+FB01>cant typhoid outbreak in
1850 meant another location was required.43 St Helena Island was used for
quarantining arrivals from 1862 and by 1865 plans were made to build some
timber structures on the island. Surveyor H.C. Rawnsley located a lagoon and
collected water samples from the ‘Native Wells’, while Colonial Architect Charles
Tif<U+FB01>n designed a simple set of timber-framed and timber-clad buildings.44 Thirty
prisoners from the hulk Proserpine began clearing the island of trees and building
Tif<U+FB01>n’s design after rowing back and forth each day in a whaleboat from their
hulk.45 Two prisoners managed to escape in the process of construction, and as
prisoner numbers continued to grow in Queensland, it was decided to convert the
quarantine station into a prison. Tif<U+FB01>n worked on the redesign, enclosing structures
in a stockade, before prisoners were moved from the hulk and held permanently on
the island from 1866.

Securing the perimeter
On 14 May 1867, St Helena Island was proclaimed a penal settlement. The <U+FB01>rst few
years were dedicated to building two cell blocks, a kitchen, bakehouse, hospital,
underground water tanks, boathouse, storehouse, jetty and Superintendents home
and stables (Figure 3). Beach rock was mined and used to construct buildings and
the western causeway, which served as the point of entry to the island.

            A fear of human-eating sharks complemented the security of the penal
      establishment, re<U+FB02>ecting a longer colonial practice of using sharks to control captive
      populations. For example, Marcus Rediker’s research on the role of sharks in the
      Atlantic slave trade reveals that colonial agents leveraged a fear of human eating
      sharks ‘as an integral part of a system of terror’ to create social discipline among
      both sailors and slaves.46 A similar system of terror was employed on St Helena
      Island. The idea that escapees from the island who were able to avoid drowning
      and swim the signi<U+FB01>cant distances to land would eventually have to take their
      chances against circling sharks was perpetrated by of<U+FB01>cials and linked to the rare
      reporting of fatal shark attacks appearing in the media. This press coverage
      was infrequent but sensational, with reporting on the fatal shark attack on
      Alexey Drury, a twelve-year-old boy swimming in the Brisbane River at Petrie
      Bight in 1880, including a blow-by-blow account of the efforts of his younger

brother and three other young friends to get him away from the shark and back to
shore for medical help.47 Lacoon, an eighteen-year-old South Sea Islander washed
overboard near Bribie Island in 1886, was reported in The Brisbane Courier to have
been ‘dragged under by a shark’.48 C. Gregory, a recreational sailor boating in
Moreton Bay in late 1890, disappeared after he and three companions were forced
to swim to shore after a squall sunk their boat, ‘and it is supposed that he was seized
by a shark, as several were seen in the vicinity’.49 John Thompson, a boy bathing in
the Brisbane River in 1901, ‘was seized by a shark, and had his thigh torn away. He
bled to death.’50 These attacks were not con<U+FB01>ned to Moreton Bay and the Brisbane
River. William Bartlett ‘was attacked by a large shark, which tore his right leg in a
shocking manner’ as he swam in the Logan River in 190351 and George Grant, a crew
member from a steamship, ‘appeared to have been seized by a shark’ while retrieving
his hat, ‘which had blown overboard’ at Brisbane in 1904.52 Despite these fatalities,
the tropical conditions made swimming increasingly attractive.
   Seaside destinations and sea bathing were linked to tourism and ideas about
health and wellbeing with the growing settlement of Redcliffe advertised as a
‘sanatorium for the sick’.53 Shark-proof swimming enclosures (kiosks and dressing
rooms) were an architectural feature of many popular Queensland beaches from the
1880s and 1890s. In Moreton Bay, at places like Sandgate and Redcliffe, permanent
swimming enclosures were built with timber-like fences alongside piers, jetties
and promenades.54 Sited in the highly transitory tidal wave zone and experiencing
corrosive marine conditions, their timber walls were prone to decay and destruc-
tion. Over time, these swimming areas were replaced and enlarged, and their
physical walls replaced with timber pylons and shark-proof fencing (see Figure 4).55
Shark-proof swimming enclosures using this netting technique continue to be built
and maintained at public beaches in Queensland, such as one at Amity Point on

      Northern Stradbroke Island near where the last fatal shark attack in Moreton Bay
      occurred in 2006.56
             Returning to St Helena, by the 1900s the penal establishment held over
      300 prisoners. Those with privileges were permitted to swim in the sea once week
      ‘at their own risk’.57 Guards supervised their activities day and night to ensure no one
      escaped. Stories circulated that sharks were fed deliberately to encourage their
      presence around the island to prevent escapes.58 Jarvis Finger found no evidence to
      suggest sharks were fed on the island as a deterrent or any documented proof that
      escaped prisoners were taken by sharks. However, he argued that a fear of shark
      attacks was promoted by authorities and the press from the earliest days of the
      maximum-security penal establishment. For example, an early escape attempt was
      accompanied by the report that ‘the men had gone into the water about two feet when
      they found the sharks so numerous that they had to refrain’ and an 1869 report stated:
         A very ef<U+FB01>cient police around the island, in the shape of sharks, which render it
         next to impossible for anyone to escape the island to the mainland by swimming.
         Several prisoners have attempted to escape that way but, when they saw the
         immense number of sharks that were swimming about, they were glad to return,
         with haste, to the island.
      Finger also found this idea still being promoted in 1914, with a report stating that
      ‘If the escapee had only thought of the sharks, he would not have made the attempt
      to escape, and the marvel is that he was not eaten.’59

      Kitikir – Burketown Peter
      Although St Helena Island held some of the state’s worst felons, it was considered a
      model prison – the isolation, high levels of security and discipline and good
      management resulted in its self-suf<U+FB01>ciency and pro<U+FB01>tability. The island operated
      as a prison for 65 years, with the last prisoner leaving the island in 1932. Escapes
      were few, with some reports highlighting the threat of sharks: ‘One of the escaping
      inmates was reportedly taken by sharks, an Aboriginal man known to his commu-
      nity on Mornington Island as Kitikir, but to the Queensland press as “Burketown
      Peter”’.60 Transported down to St Helena and imprisoned for the murder of a
      missionary, the press surrounding Kitikir’s escape was sensational, <U+FB01>rst reporting
      his swimming escape:
         Still at Large. The whereabouts of the [A]boriginal Burketown Peter, who disap-
         peared from the St Helena Prison on Sunday, has not yet been discovered : : : It is not
         improbable that the blackfellow, accustomed to the Gulf country and familiar with
         phases of life, is an accomplished swimmer, and that he has attempted to reach either
         Mud or Green Island, though the result of the police search would seem to disfavor
         this theory. These waters are reputed to be infested with sharks, but the blacks of the
         Far North are not unfamiliar with the task of <U+FB01>ghting such an enemy, from which
         they are also less liable to attack than white men.61
      Newspaper reports at the time suggested his death was from drowning and shark
      attack:

                                                                  Sharing the waterways

  Burketown Peter, a full-blooded [A]boriginal, escaped from his cell in January
  1921, and put to sea in a raft of planks. He was seen and pursued. Diving from the
  raft, he did not return to the surface and was probably taken by sharks.62
However, his cause of death remains uncertain, with later reports suggest that
Kitikir had been shot while escaping, with the ‘son of a former warder on the island,
cryptically, perhaps knowingly, stating: “I think he might have been despatched by
other means”.’63

Shark-proof swimming enclosure
St Helena Island housed prisoners and a community of prison wardens. It was during
the reign of St Helena Island Penal Establishment’s <U+FB01>fth Superintendent, John
Alexander MacDonald, that a shark-proof swimming enclosure and dressing shed
for off-duty wardens was constructed alongside the wharf in 1916.64 Unlike the large
public swimming enclosures built of timber piles found along the Queensland
coastline, the shark-proof swimming enclosure at St Helena Penal Establishment
was made with <U+FB01>xed walls constructed from railway lines driven vertically into the
sand with spaces between each pile to allow the <U+FB02>ow of seawater. It was approxi-
mately 40 x 20 feet (12.1 x 6.1 metres) in size and was built during a period when a
range of recreational facilities were being built on the island for warders, including a
cricket pitch and tennis court.65 It was used only for the recreational swimming of off-
duty prison warders.66 While providing a recreational swimming place for warders,
the enclosure visually reinforced to prisoners and visitors the administration’s
narrative that the waters around St Helena were full of human-eating sharks.
   The swimming enclosure was accompanied by a timber dressing shed and,
despite the tragic death of a warder who broke his neck diving into the pool at
low tide at night in December 1917, it was very popular with off-duty warders.67
For years after the penal establishment closed, this swimming enclosure was central
to thwarted development plans seeking to create a health resort or tourist destina-
tion in Moreton Bay.68 It is still visible at the end of the ruins of the original
causeway beside the National Park arrival jetty. Sharks are also still observed
around St Helena Island, with National Parks Rangers witnessing large numbers
from time to time – especially off the northern tip where they avoid swimming.69
St Helena’s shark-proof swimming enclosure is a rare and valuable heritage asset,
for despite being linked to memories of coastal holidays and evidenced in family and
state photographic collections, there is little in the public record about the history,
design and construction of <U+FB01>xed shark-proof swimming enclosures in Queensland
(Figure 5).
   This research has shown that in terms of sharing the sub-tropical waters
of Moreton Bay with local sharks, quite different cultural approaches existed.
As skilled swimmers, the Quandamooka people coexisted with sharks, swimming
among them and catching and eating small species. In contrast, new colonial
arrivals were unfamiliar with sharks, fearing their attack. From the earliest days
of European settlement, an inability of migrants to swim and a fear of sharks were
leveraged to detain migrants to Moreton Bay on St Helena Island, brie<U+FB02>y as a
quarantine station and later as a penal establishment. European settlement activities
likely increased shark numbers at densely populated sites and increased the chances
of human–shark interaction. Rare cases of fatal shark attack were publicly shared,

                                                                      Queensland Review    131

      and sensational reporting paralleled the growth of public bathing facilities that used
      physical barriers to separate sharks from human swimmers. In 1916, at a time when
      recreational swimming was growing, a shark-proof swimming enclosure was built
      on St Helena to support the leisure activities of warders and visually reinforce a fear
      of sharks among detained prisoners. As beachside communities of Australia used
      shark nets and fencing to manage people’s increased interactions and fear of sharks,
      St Helena Island’s shark-proof swimming enclosure provides a rare surviving
      example of a permanent physical barrier in the tidal zone to contain swimmers.
      The swimming enclosure at St Helena is signi<U+FB01>cant because it evidences an earlier
      period in our history when communities sought to balance a desire to swim with a
      fear of sharks.
