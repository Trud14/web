       ship looms            the island              of     St. Helena                 in   the
       distance        as    we        stand         on      the deck                 of    the


        brings it into greater prominence.       Soon
        the  battleship form  fades away,  and  in it?
        stead appears  a  Blrangely picturesque islet.
         iWhat    a  contrast       iB here—a    low shore   of
         rather forbidding aspect, aud above             this a
         cliff-like rise, with a long building perched
         oa  its summit       ;
                                  then, just a little bit to

        .wavy    mas?             of    green,   and   round    the whole
        the   ocean,          fretting        and    bubbling in a line
        of snowy             foam.           Gloom     and   shadow—ay,
                                         for  there    is
         and      grandeur,                                somethipg in
        that      great       sweep           upwards              towards               the sky

          Such  is our   first glance at the island   into
        .whose  secrets     we    are   about    to peop.
        Quietly round      to the landing place slips
        the Ottor, with      ever  slackening speed till
        a last throb   of the screw    drives her along-
        Side the woodon       wharf.       Passing through a
        file of blue-capped warders            we    are    greeted
        by   a  dignified,  boarded      gontleraan In mufti
        —Mr.      Ryan,     the      superintendent of the
        prison.     He  takes    us   out   to the       kangaroo,

        Worked     by four Kanakas           in a manner         al
        taost precisely similar         to the      railway tri

         front.        The        Kanakas                 bend         backwards    and
         forwards quickly like so                             many         automatons,

        iwe  have    scarcely asked ourselves the ques
        tion  before    the light is shut out  by a lofty
        stockade,     massively built, and    beside this
        appears    a   sentry-box on stilts, holding in
        side a watchful      warder, who    stands   close
        beside hlB loaded      carbine.  A little further
        on      is    a    heavy           iron
                             gate leading into the
        Interior           of    the
                       prison, with   three warders
        looking through the bars.   The gate opens,
        and   we  pass through into Avernus.
          St. 'Helena Is not by any    means  a modern
        frlson, for instead  of being oircu'ar    and all
         he passages    leading to a common       centre,
        It is oiblong,  and  the  different  ways    con

        verge        only   the gate. 'Mr. Ryan

        please." A             second  iron gate folds back, and
        we     are        ushered into a little courtyard, then
        turn to            the       right, and
                                 proceeding along a
