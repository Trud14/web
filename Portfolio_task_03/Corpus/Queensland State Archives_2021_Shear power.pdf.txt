      Shear power: Shearer’s strike of 1891
                     21 DECEMBER, 2021 BY QUEENSLAND STATE ARCHIVES




  The 1891 shearers’ strike is one of Australia’s earliest and most important
  industrial disputes. The quarrel was primarily between unionised and non-
  unionised wool workers, and sabotage and violence issued from both sides. The
  strike is seen as one of the factors that led to the formation of the Australian Labor

Party.




    Manifesto of the Strike Committee issued to the members of the Queensland Shearers’ Union and
    Queensland Labourers’ Union, 20 June 1891; ITM1137546




Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, Queensland had enjoyed growth and economic
prosperity. During this same period, socialist ideas and the development of various
trade unions enabled workers to band together to establish conditions for fair
work. Sheep shearers, whose roving lifestyles and key functions in the pastoral
industry provided them with formidable bargaining tools, were particularly
confrontational in their efforts to achieve fair working conditions.

In late 1890, as the international depression caused the price of wool to fall, rural
employers drastically reduced wages and entitlements for shearers. On 5 January
1891, the Queensland Shearers’ Union and the Queensland Labourers’ Union
gathered in Barcaldine, the centre of a rich pastoral district, to set up a strike

committee headquarters. Strike camps were formed throughout Queensland and
New South Wales. For months, negotiations between employers and unions were
unsuccessful.

In early February, pastoral employers began importing non-unionised free labour
by train from Victoria. Strikers intercepted these new arrivals by detaching
carriages and even attempted to destroy a railway bridge. The dispute escalated
rapidly. Torchlight processions of over a thousand men began in Barcaldine, and on
10 March 1891 the con�ict came to a head as nearly 1,500 unionists blocked the
railway platform.

Consequently, a military camp was set up near the Barcaldine courthouse and
roughly 1,000 military personnel were distributed to monitor strikers’ camps

throughout Queensland. Thirteen of the strike’s organisers were arrested in
March 1891 and sent to St Helena Island prison for three years hard labour.
Following this setback, and with increasingly poor conditions, the strike began to
lose momentum. By mid-June, the strike was called off and the defeated unionists
went back to work on the pastoralists’ terms.

Although unsuccessful, the legacy of the shearers’ strike lies in the interests of
workers becoming part of the political agenda. In 1892, unions met in Barcaldine
to form the ‘Workers Political Party’, which later became the Australian Labor
Party. Its vision included using parliamentary power to achieve decent working
conditions for all. And ever since the days of the 1891 shearers’ strike, workers
have come together to demand their right to fair employment.




Convicted of conspiracy
They called them snaggers, snappers and learners. In the shearers’ strike of 1891,
‘free labourers’ poured into Queensland under the protection of police troopers.

‘It doesn’t bother us in the least, they would not shear as many sheep in a day as
one competent workman’ wrote a unionist.

After four long months of rallies, strikes and protests with wealthy
squatters about working conditions, it was all over. At 9 o’clock on 26 May 1891, a
van drove the conspiracy prisoners from the gaol at Rockhampton to the wharf,
where 150 people yelled cheers of encouragement as 21 men boarded the
Government steamer Otter and were taken to St Helena Island.

While some shearers had been charged with riotous conduct, unlawful assembling
or arson, the leaders were charged with sedition and conspiracy. The statute
penalised workers, either as individuals or groups of individuals, for trying to
improve their conditions at work. For this crime, they were sentenced to three
years imprisonment on St Helena Island, also known as ‘Queensland’s Inferno’.

Strike leader Julian Stuart recalled that shearers’ strike prisoners were taken
directly from Rockhampton to St Helena Island ‘because the authorities feared a
demonstration.’ As the prisoners arrived, they were brought into the stockade on
horse-drawn trams and moved into separate cells. They were then
photographed. Each prisoner at St Helena was required to work a trade on the
island. William Hamilton worked pipe-claying steps and cleaning windows with the
Housemaids Gang, Julian Stuart laid a �oor in the pigsty and George Taylor worked
in the tailor’s shop.
