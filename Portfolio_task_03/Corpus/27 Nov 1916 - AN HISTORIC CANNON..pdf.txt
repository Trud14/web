AN HISTORIC CANNON.

At the penal establishment at St. Helena there is an old 24-pounder gun which was cast in
1802. What are its historical associations is at present un-known, but it is easy to imagine
through

what scenes the gun may have passed. Its use at the prison was to give warn-ing in the event
of prisoners escaping, but as modern methods, such as the telephone, are now in operation, the
Homo Secretary is discussing the ad-visableness of transferring the gun and oak timber, both
in good order, to Bris-bane.

The suggestion might here be made that the gun in question and the gun sent out by Kitchener
may perhaps find a position side by side.
