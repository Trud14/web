There are two figures in the fields, one with a horse. There are paddocks, and I’m not sure what the white structure is.</p> <p><u>What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?</u></p> <p>It may have been taken as a means to promote and report back on the success of the prison without walls camp (Taylor 2010). This idea combined the need for self-sufficiency and free farm labour (Taylor 2010; Unknown 20 March 1878). This image shows prisoners working the open fields, not chained or with a warder in sight.</p> <p><u>Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?</u></p> <p>I think it has been staged. The two prisoners look to be standing still. One does not have any tools or water buckets, and the other is standing in front of a horse, looking forward or back, not on the side as would expect if walking the horse.</p> <p><u>Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give you that information?</u></p> <p>It came from the period sometime between 1913 and 1932. I can tell this because the prison without walls idea did not take hold until around 1913 (Taylor 2010), and St Helena Prison closed in 1932 (Alfredson 1983).</p> <p><u>How is the image composed?

The men are sitting on the benches lining the barn, with similar clothes on, a uniform. I can make out numbers on the back of some men’s shirts. All the men in white are facing away from the camera. Men in dark clothes look at, and pose for, the camera. A smartly dressed man, in a bowler hat, three-piece suit, and cane/stick, poses halfway down the building. Another two figures stand in the distance, wearing dark clothes. A man in dark clothes in the foreground and to the right appears to be wearing an old police or military uniform. One of the people using a sewing machine is wearing dark clothes, and I think has hair up in a bun. Why would one woman be among all men, wearing different clothes?</p> </div>; <div data-schema-version=""8""><p>permalink</p> <p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/41RDCe1.jpg"" alt="""" data-attachment-key=""PZNGDZZ3"" width=""5078"" height=""3896""></p> </div>; <div data-schema-version=""8""><h3>Structured reflection</h3> <p><u>What objects or physical features are in the image?</u></p> <p>There is an old iron, cloth or fabric bundles, prisoners, a warder, a smartly dressed man. There is a lot of fabric/cloth hanging from beams, an old-style iron on the table, and a row of early sewing machines, so these men must be tailors.</p> <p><u>What is the context of the image? Why was it taken?</u></p> <p>To report back or promote the work that the prisoners are doing. Free labour, making a profit for the penal establishment, everything, right down to making police uniforms (Whittington 13 February 2021). Propaganda for budgets. It shows men working, not just sitting in cells, and they are not shackled up, which could be trying to show reformation is working.</p> <p><u>Is the photo spontaneous or staged? How do you know?</u></p> <p>I think it’s staged, as the smartly dressed man is standing, waiting for the photo to be taken. The men are all sitting, staring straight ahead, and look to be too close together to be working.</p> <p><u>Can you tell from which time period it came? What clues give you that information?</u></p> <p>I think the image is from around the late 1800s to just after the turn of the century. The man has a bowler hat on, carries a cane/stick, and is wearing a three-piece suit. He is wearing fashion from around the 1870s (Matthews 2016) and is sporting a moustache that fits the time period. there are no lights hanging from the roof. I say before or around 1882 because electricity was supplied to Brisbane in 1882 (Scholz Electrical 2021).</p> <p><u>How is the image composed?
